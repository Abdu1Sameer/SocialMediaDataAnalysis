I’ve had quite a journey with anti-depressants for 6-7 months and I am finally slowly (very slowly) getting better.

Thing is though everything is scary, because I’ve spent so long isolating and severely depressed and anxious, all thoughts are still scary.
Work, socializing, working out. My brain jumps to negative connotations whenever I consider any of it.

How do you tell your body you’re safer now? Or help yourself get out of depression?

I’m finding it very hard to enjoy most things and most interactions.

1jgjnh5,1742571312.0,"My partner might have post partum psychosis. Please can anyone give advice? Me and my partner had our second child about 5 months ago. About 1 month ago, our baby started being fussy at night and that caused my partner (who was handling nights because she believed it would be better for both of us) to stop sleeping. This then affected her anxiety to the point she had suicidal ideation  and ended up hospitalising herself.

While in the hospital she appears to have become paranoid about me. Before all of this, we had the kind of relationship where we never even raise our voices at one another. We always sit down together, hold each others hand and reassure one another even over very difficult conversations. I believed our relationship was loving and kind and we did the kinds of things that supportive partners do for each other, the kinds of things relationship therapists would recommend.

However while she was in hospital she has begun to believe that I am coercively controlling her. She was discharged from the hospital and ended up leaving with both our children and raised a protective order against me, as though I might follow and stalk her or threaten to hurt someone. I would never, ever do anything like that and I'm scared out of my mind at this change in her.

She has said that this control took the form of isolating her from friends and family, controlling our finances and manipulation. The irony being, I moved to her home country to support her while her mother was dying and we stayed because when we had children together, I wanted her to be close to her family and friends for support. We have joint bank accounts that she has full access to both our joint account and our savings account. I put almost all my own wages into these accounts so we both have money, believing we'd agreed all this together. I thought our move and house purchase was similarly something we both agreed to and wanted, but now I'm terrified I've somehow hurt her or put her in harms way.

I'm out of my mind with worry and fear right now. This is so unlike her in every way. They've caused me to question my own sanity, as I'm scared I am the things she's saying and I've somehow not noticed or that I've hidden it from myself somehow. But then when I go over the facts, that doesn't seem to make rational sense.

Can anyone help guide me? What should I do to help and support her, while not causing her more fear? Should I just go no contact and no message her at all, or give her full custody of the children so she feels safe and secure with that? I would do anything to show this person that I would do anything for her and our children's wellbeing.

Does anyone know how long delusions or fears like these might last? Please if anyone can help, please reach out.

I just want to reiterate, even if my partner doesn't want to be together anymore, I would support her in that and work things through in a way that made sure everyone was safe and happy.

1jgh7fa,1742564832.0,"INTP struggles Something off my chest

Hey all,

26M here… For my whole life my head was always full of ideas and monologues. Worrying about stuff has always been a part of me. I would say that I never struggled in school but I was always aware that procrastination is my biggest flaw and it really hinders my ability to become the best version of myself.

I finished high school, went on to studying Mechanical Engineering - enjoyed it but did not finish my diploma. I enrolled into IT program 2 years ago and I am enjoying it but the fucking inner monologues are killing me, procrastination is on another level and it’s showing on my exams. Went through a breakup recently and it hit me harder than expected, this combined with my unfinished bussines from the past (diploma in mechanical eng. - I will finish it this year in summer) is fucking me up mentally. I am super into cycling, hiking and skiing and tbh this is the only thing that is keeping me joyful and excited for the future.

Thinking about future worries me to the point where I think about it and stress over it 24/7, just the usual thoughts about not having a good career, what career do I even want - self doubt I guess.

Well to make my point, I discovered this sub after completing a personality test which resulted in INTP. I read about this type of personality and could really find myself in the descriptions. Idk if this post might come off as suicidal but I am not… just having an INTP crisis I guess. Also English is not my first language so I apologise for any grammar mistakes.

How do you deal with shit like this? Procrastination is avoidable by just doing it but the part where your brain runs thoughts about irrelevant stuff is a nut too hard to crack for me.

1jgbn6c,1742543715.0,"Everything had been piling up for so long and seems to get worse TW: Sexual Assault, Self Harm, and Topic on Suicide

Long story short, my dad overdosed himself March 28th, 2017. My brother was shot and murdered April 1st, 2018. My mom passed due to leukemia January 27th, 2019. My other brother hung himself Feburary 22nd, 2019. My grandpa passed due to complications of covid December 9th, 2020. Lots of deaths piled up, and after my grandpa, the abuse got worse with my grandma.

Ever since my grandpa passed, my grandma became most abuse, both physically and mentally. On December 29th, 2022, my boyfriend raped me. I never told anyone about it until more recently (more on that later). 

On October 3rd, 2023, I tried to take my own life. I struggled with suicidal thoughts ever since I was 11 when I lost my dad. This was my first attempt and it was my grandma that pushed me to it. She told me she wished I was dead. Afterwards, she was angry at me and told me I was just like my dad. A coward. She didn’t want to go to the hospital with me and told me she was going to stay home. She had to show up because she was my legal guardian and I was 17 at the time. She didn’t even want to talk to me. I stayed in psychiatric hospital for 2 weeks and I fell into a major depression afterwards. They diagnosed me with GAD (generalized anxiety disorder) and bipolar disorder. I was able to get through it after a few months of trying to work on it and taking medication to calm my symptoms. Things were looking up until April 6th, 2024. One of my friends texted me asking me to hang out because he felt depressed only for him to go on and rape me at the park. This drove me to self harm even more (I started self harming after my ex boyfriend raped me by hammering my left wrist with a small hammer and bruising my wrist, I used to blame it on tendinitis and no one questioned it). The only person I had told about these two events of sa was my current boyfriend. I told my grandma about my ex boyfriend raping me more recently (December 2024) and she blamed me for it. For allowing it to happen. For not screaming. For not telling anybody. She even said I betrayed her by telling my boyfriend about it before her. She even told me it wasn’t rape. I didn’t tell her before because I knew she wouldn’t believe me and would blame me for it. She makes my pain all about her. I can’t go out with her because she always tries to make people feel bad for me by telling random strangers such as store cashiers or waitresses about how “she lost her dad my son, her mom, my husband, and my two grandsons”. She does it to get pity and make people feel bad so she gets what she wants. She’s also racist towards my boyfriend (he’s Vietnamese and I’m Mexican) and says “it’ll never work because asians and mexicans dont mix”. My therapist I saw for a few months and recently stopped seeing said that my grandma treats me like a dog, and she’d call CPS if I wasn’t an adult. I want to leave because she doesn’t give me any freedom. I need to ask her for permission to do anything. She forces me to weigh myself in front of her, she taped my mouth as a kid because I “talked too much”, she calls me names such as elephant, tries to isolate me and doesn’t let  hang out with my friends because “they’ll disappoint me and I only have her”. She’s done so much more to me that has broken me as a person. That’s only the tip of the iceberg. I’ve needed to get this all out.

I was in the military (it’s obligatory where I’m coming from). I had developed a skin condition that made me lose my hair, and led me to start my journey to health. Very quickly I have stumbled upon raw veganism/rawtill4.
In the beginning it made me feel good, for one year approximatey, but fairly quickly I started feeling really bad, and essentially lost who I was before that.
Before embarking on that journey, I was a young, handsome, popular, sharp, happy, 6’2, fit, man, and after one year I became depressed, sick, skinny (130lbs), introverted and enclosed in my room.
My digestion was always awful, my energy was non-existent, and I felt ashamed of who I’ve become.
Things got slightly better at time, my weight flactuated, I managed to create some romantic relationships over the years, but I have kept struggling physically and emotionally. I lost most of my friendships and stopped engaging in life.
In 2020, approx when covid hit, things got worse.
Without getting too much into details, my health got much worse and I developed terrible persistent symptoms such as brainfog, confusion, dizzy spells, and what not.
I gained tons of weight and reached 260lbs.
Only recently I’ve found out that the issue all these years was that I was deficient in minerals and mainly in sodium. Lately I introduced salt back into my diet after years of avoiding it, as well as daily salads, and I finally feel like I’m gettint back to who I was.
It’s nice to start feeling better finally, but now I’m 33 years old, all my friends are married with kids, have decent jobs, and I’m single, fat (I lost about 30lbs already since my peak weight, but still I’m fat and I will prolly have loose skin), I’m balding, and have no accomplishements or achievements in life.
I feel like I’ve wasted my prime years, my youth, my once young and beautiful body, and I feel so sad about it. I can’y help thinking constantly about how things could’ve been different haf I only eaten salt like a notmal person, how stupid I was.
My only consolation is hoping that reincarnations are real, cause I pray for a second chance.

I don’t want something that’s going to make me feel nothing I want to feel joy, sadness, anger, excitement, etc. How did you get those feelings back??? It’s all I want and I’m desperate.  I feel numb but I’ve been masking it for months. I’ve been really good at not self harming (almost 2 years clean) but times like this when I want to feel it sneaks back into my mind.

1jgbbzt,1742542284.0,"I‘m so overwhelmed and I don‘t know what to do anymore Heyyy guys,

I don‘t even know how to start this. So first a little background info: I am currently in high school, near graduation and have a history with mental health problems, but not with self harm. I was never diagnosed with anything, even though I had two therapists who were more focused on discovering why smth was wrong and not how they could actively help me with my problems (there weren’t other types of therapists in my area). Last year I was doing a lot better (I don‘t know why), so I quit therapy and concentrated on my friends and hobby’s. Since then it has come back in waves, so that I just suddenly feel really bad without a reason. 

I experience a lot of stress right now due to school. My grades are getting really bad and I often need to skip school due to headaches or fainting issues (I don‘t have a diagnose there either), which makes me feel really guilty. My parents are normally really supportive, but even they have their limits and that was reached about four months ago. When I am feeling bad it often is accompanied by anger, loss of appetite, anxiety or often the need to constantly eat whatever is available. I told my parents about nearly all of this and they always say they support me and say that they want me to feel better, but I don‘t think they grasp the severity of the situation, when I say I can‘t do this anymore. I often said that I wanted to speak to a therapist again, but I can‘t make an appointment and they just brush it off. 

Today I had a situation again, which makes me write this post. I am currently sick at home (the flu) and was also last week where I should have written an exam but was unable to attend So that I talked to my teacher to write the exam today. This morning I woke up feeling like shit and also with a big headache So I was not really able to move or even think. My mom noticed but made me get up (which I understand). I physically couldn‘t and still can‘t really move that much because it makes me want to Vomit so I decided to stay home (I‘d rather have a bad grade due to administration than due to my own failure). My mom is now really disappointed and ignores me, which does not help to make me feel better at all, but I understand why she reacts that way. I felt really angry though and wanted to just break something, be it a glass bottle, the window or a bone, but I can control this pretty good. Even though I can control most of my thoughts when it comes to things that would have severe consequences, I am still pretty scared of them because I don‘t know how to tell anyone what happens inside my head at least once a day. 

In conclusion, I have absoluty no idea what to do now. I wanna get hep, because I don‘t know how I can help myself, but I don‘t think my parents will help me much. I mostly just want to be normal and be able to live my life without those episodes. Do u have any suggestions or advice you can give me on how to deal with this?

My younger brother is dealing with some pretty serious stuff right now, such as bad anxiety, suicidal thoughts, self harm, and more. I have never dealt with anything anywhere near as serious, however I do believe I have a decent understanding of mental health which has helped me be more empathetic towards others. 

I'm close with my brother and we've always talked to each other about things. I genuinely care about him. I have always comforted my friends when they needed, and I have comforted my brother a lot, all out of genuinely caring for these people and wanting them to feel better even if it's just a little bit.

However when it comes to my brother, sometimes I care but sometimes I just.. don't. I don't know why. For example the other night he was talking to me about something, and I genuinely cared and I talked to him for a few hours. But there have been other times where he has tried doing that same thing and I don't care at all, or I even feel annoyed.

Seriously, what the fuck? He has had panic attacks before and while my parents comfort him, I feel annoyed that he's being so loud. Even though I'm aware panic attacks are horrible, and I would know how to help, I just didn't care enough. There have also been times where he was talking to me, or asked to talk to me, and I would think ""ugh.."". 

Logically, I know his feelings are valid. He is dealing with a lot and his feelings are real. While he is getting therapy and help from my parents, it is also probably helpful to have someone like me who is closer to his age who he can talk to more casually. 

But for whatever reason I think part of me doesn't take him seriously.

1jg300y,1742513474.0,"I got a PAP smear today, and I'm freaking out a bit Additional TW for the brief mention of cancer/a family member with terminal cancer.

So I got my first ever PAP smear today after having avoided doing one for a few years out of anxiety and fear. I won't go into details about it all, of course, but one of the reasons I avoided doing it was because I've been assaulted a few times in the past. I absolutely dread anyone touching me down there without having built up that intimate kind of relationship with them, to the point I waited forever before doing anything with my actual partner. 

However, cancer does run in my mom's side of the family, with her being terminal from something that started off as cervical cancer, so I put my fears aside and just got it over with. The actual exam wasn't so bad, they used one of the smaller things and the woman doing it was very kind and gentle. Very uncomfortable, but I got through it. It's after the exam, and when I got home that things went downhill.

I'm not in any pain, just uncomfortable down there still. I also don't really know how to explain how I'm feeling mentally? I just want to shrink down and curl up into a ball or something. This doesn't feel like myself usual panic or anxiety attacks, and it's thankfully not a full-blown PTSD episode, but I still feel very out of it. I'm very much aware of how I'm feeling down there, like, painfully so. The doctor was so nice, but I still feel very violated in a sense.

1jg7613,1742526046.0,"Have you tried an Alpha Stim? I received an Alpha Stim device in 2014 for my extreme anxiety that’s now classified as panic disorder with agoraphobia. Someone ended up stealing the device and left me with the pads and solution (haha, idiot couldn’t use it without the accessories). I asked my psychiatrist if I could get a new one, and he informed me his clinic didn’t have them nor order them. 

I had an appointment on Monday for a regular check-in. I thought to ask about one again. He said he could order one and have it mailed (I do telehealth appointments and my medications are mailed to me). 

I thought, I wonder how many people have heard of this wonderful device. It’s great for anxiety, depression, insomnia, and one model is for pain relief, too. 

Personally, I think it’s better than Xanax/Valium/Ativan/etc for my anxiety. One, I don’t get any form of intoxication. Once the device is powered off, I can do things like drive (if I wanted), operate machinery, etc. Two, my anxiety drops from sheer panic to mild annoyance within a minute or two. I don’t have to worry about lingering effects. 

I’m curious, have you heard of this device? If you have, have you used it? If you have used it, what do you think of it? I’m looking to hear everyone’s opinion. Would you try it if given a chance?

In spite of the achievements and talents I hold I always feel like I come short. Also, I worry of not meeting people's expectations if I were to apply myself to the things I want in life. 

One of those is my art. I've always wanted to be an artist since I was 16, now 25m, and my ex was an an artist of sorts too. He spent 8 years drilling insecurities into me. He never had time for my art, he always talked about his and his backstories. Then it was tracing, which is bad to pass that off as your own, but essential for when you're learning to draw. He'd take beef with artists he believed were tracing and some of them got cancelled over it which reinforced my fears. Im an insecure person, and the thought of someone calling my art out and/or cancelling me is scary.

Even though he around anymore, it still affects me. It gives me so much anxiety when I draw. I'll avoid drawing by doing other things, or if I try sometimes I'll freeze. When I freeze, I feel a disconnect followed by increasing self-doubt. It used to apply to commission work, where Id fall behind after a few weeks. But for a while I've had the same feeling towards personal work. I cringe at ALL my work and I feel ""unqualified"" to draw because I didn't study it at school.

1jg5865,1742519976.0,"Trying to break a long line of mental health issues - my update So, looking back at my family history, there seems to be a trace of mental illness in various degrees. My father's mother was not able to take care of my dad and his sister, so he grew up with his grandparents. And my mother's mom had severe anxiety and was medicated after escaping the Second World War.  
  
My dad seemed to have something, in particular when I was a kid.  
My brother was bipolar and became a drug addict. And I lost him in 2019 because of it.  
  
My own story is that the first time my mom took me to a psychiatrist I was about 6 years old. It was because I had been a very happy, outgoing child, and suddenly I became introverted, aggressive, and depressed. I think it was because I had around that time started to get severely bullied.  
  
All my life, now M34, I’ve been in and out of therapy sessions, drug and alcohol addiction. Showcasing pretty strong signs of borderline, bipolar, and anxiety issues. However, when I finally stopped drinking 13 months ago, a lot of those things went away. Slowly, I’m building my life up again, and although there is a lot of anxiety-inducing stuff left in my life to clean up, it's getting better.  
  
The thing that happened 13 months ago is that I finally understood (I'm slow, I know) that I need to take charge of my improvement. Not just go to a therapist hoping they fix me with some magical solution. But to actually identify my issues, to the best of my abilities, and do some research: what kind of therapy is good for my type of issues. That helped me find a therapy that would actually do something for me.  
  
And, of course, eliminate a big trigger, which in my case was alcohol, and in the further past, drugs.

I have multiple diagnosed conditions (depression, ocd, anxiety) but do not have bipolar disorder. I have been evaluated multiple times for things over the years and it has never been a concern, however am on some typically bipolar meds due to treatment resistant depression.

For the first time ever I am experiencing what I can only assume some form of mania feels like for the last two weeks, while still also being super depressed. 

I have been speaking fast (noticed by multiple people and told to slow down), overbooking myself with multiple conflicting things at the same time over and over again, not taking breaks at work and just working through it, eating less, jittery, shaky, racing thoughts, jumping from one thing to another, rushing around and bumping into things, etc. As a result of being “revved up” my ocd compulsions and self harm have both increased ( disclaimer: I am being as safe with that as possible/no current safety risk). I am still sleeping “normally”(which is poor sleep).

Nothing else medically or medication wise has changed recently. I brought it up to my therapist and psychiatrist and my psychiatrist is going to see me next sooner than normal.

It is just really weird and is getting worse by the day. I am concerned, frustrated, and just feeling awful all around. So yeah, idk 🤷‍♀️

1jft0cy,1742488318.0,"Dating when your mental healths baseline is getting by. How? 
I’m single after 16 years and a newly out lesbian.
So I’ve finally taken the plunge got on some dating sites. I’m not looking for anything serious I want to dip my feet in the pool.

My mental health has consisted of me just keeping my head above water. I can’t work and although I’ve spent years in a cycle forcing myself into jobs, burning out, getting ill, in patient, getting better then doing it again. I’m finally starting to accept where I am and that although I’m now not suicidal I do still need to take it slow. I’m currently looking into volunteering.

How do I date with this. I’m okay with where I am. But I don’t think the dating pool will understand. 

Doing a Google throws up people giving advice to others about waiting until stable. But this is me stable. I’ve been like this all my life (I’m 37) 

My stable is obvs not where I wish to be. Although I try not to dwell. But if I wait for the stability that society deems ‘normal’ I’ll never put myself out there. But I deserve relationships right. I don’t have to be bloody celibate. 

Side note: Someone’s come across my screen who says she’s a psychologist in her bio. She’s looking for community as well as partners. Should I like her profile? Would you? Like she’s  a person too right..

1jg317x,1742513566.0,"Playing an instrument can be an incredibly helpful coping mechanism/resource &I wish more people knew that I truly believe I wouldn’t be here today if my parents didn’t make it possible for me to learn an instrument.

(TW: Mention of self harm and past suicidal thoughts)

Sometimes my violin was the one and only thing keeping me from acting on suicidal thoughts and it still plays a major role for my mental health. It’s one of the (if not THE) most effective skills against self harm for me. Sometimes it’s the only thing that has ANY positive effect and I’m so incredibly thankful I have this privilege, that this instrument exists, that music exists cause hell, idk what I would do without. It’s the ability to transfer the negative energy, all those feelings into tones and scream it out into the world via music, without having to scream/talk about whatever bad thoughts keep circling in my mind. I can play a heartfelt song, a sad song, an angry/furious song, a funny song, I can put my playlist on shuffle, just to try and distract myself, go into flow, stomp or dance in my room while playing, get the energy out. I can’t scream or cry, I’ve always been bad at verbalizing feelings and opening up, but I found this way of channeling my feelings into music that calms the absolute chaos, the “too much!”, the “I can’t handle this anymore!” in my mind.

During my darkest times, it was a commitment, (somewhat) suicide prevention and gave me a sense of self-efficacy. Social anxiety made it hard for a while but knowing the orchestra “needed” me, I had my solos to play during our many concerts gave me something to hold on to, a reason to not leave this earth for just another week or two. Another orchestra and the choir had a similar effect on me. It gave my life structure, taking my lessons made gave me some sense of control: “I can still do things. I feel like shit, I wanna die, but I can still do this one thing and judging by the feedback I get, I’m good at this”. Now that I live in a college dorm I got an electric violin now which is super silent and (in moderation) makes it possible for me to play at night if shit hits the fan. 10/10, would recommend! I ditched the technique practice, ditched the sheet music - I play by ear only.
You don’t have to like classical music, you don’t have to like the technical part of practicing, I sure didn’t.
But I’m thankful I kept playing cause no matter what happens, my violin will be there for me.

I know music and playing an instrument isn’t for everybody but honestly, it saved my life and I wish more people, especially parents saw and knew how incredibly helpful music (singing, playing an instrument, or simply listening) can be in the long run, how much of a mental health resource it can be, especially for those who struggle to verbalize their struggles. It’s like martial arts to help redirect aggression. But different.

I am easily affected by interactions with girls and I keep doing stuff that actively hurts me such as being on dating apps or chasing girls who don’t give a fuck about me. Now that’s not that I dont get matches with girls that look good, it’s just that this talk with multiple girls affects me badly, I sometimes check my phone multiple times for a reply and I just hate those games but also play them.

Moreover I give too much weight for other people’s opinion, it’s like im too afraid to make a mistake, even if it’s about wearing something that doesn’t look that good. I just lack confidence and it feels like I seek other people’s approval too much.

I know that its common in this generation where social media made approval so clear, whether its likes or followers on instagram or views on tiktok but I just feel like im yearning for this too much.

Both for improving my breathing issue and to get rid from my nasal bump thinking that I can feel more comfortable and love myself cause I was insecure about my nasal bump and thought it made my face ugly but people around me used to find me conventionally beautiful. Anyways I had the surgery and post surgery process was so hard for me to deal with and I regretted the whole process from the day 1. Lots of swelling and an unpredictable period of time that I need to wait at least 1 year for all the swelling to go down. Also I was regretful cause I questioned myself a lot why did I want to change the features that’s unique to me. All of these thoughts adding up the swelling on my face, I became too depressed and lived with a big regret. I used to cry everyday why did I do this myself cause before the surgery I didn’t have this mature mentality that I should have loved myself the way I am. I really do think now that most of the cosmetic surgery procedures actually don’t make us more beautiful, real beauty is actually within the natural look and accepting yourself the way you are.  I started seeing a therapist. I go to therapy regularly, it helped me a lot I don’t cry as much. But now I am with a fake nose, I feel so ugly and I don’t look like myself in the mirror (my face changed but not too much thankfully, I still look like myself).

1jfl6t9,1742463989.0,"I don‘t know if I am traumatized… Me (f, 14) was in a relationship with a two years older guy last year (I was 13, he was 15). It started out as fake dating because I got teased by his friends before that and he promised me that if we would act like we were a couple they would stop.

In this relationship he has told me about…well sexual stuff like positioning, orgasm, etc. which I, as an immature child have found funny. He has also send me furry pornography. Not only that he also made me do sexual things like moaning. It got more and more extreme and now I‘m starting to think that he was using my immaturity and naivety to make me do said sexual things.

I couldn’t break up with him earlier because he told me that he was going to kill himself if I did and he told me that he was mentally ill (depressed, autistic, schizophrenic, etc.)

There was also an incident where he lied to me about some people blackmailing him and planning to kill him. Then he wanted to kiss me even though I felt uncomfortable and didn’t stop asking until I actually did. There was another incident where he sent me a video about two people dancing romantically on TikTok and when I said I didn’t want to do that he started insulting me.

He also started to isolate me from my friends to the point that I only had him. 

The sexual things got extreme to the point that he wanted to pull me by his necklace like he was a dog and I felt extremely uncomfortable by doing so but I simply couldn’t say no because he told me about his mental illnesses. Then when he was kissing me I was also uncomfortable but I still didn’t say no to that. Sometimes I backed off but he always was begging me until I agreed. 

Thankfully I never slept with him though.

Now I‘m starting to think that he was using me but on the other hand I see much worse stories online. I don‘t know what to think.

I’ve had depressive/suicidal thoughts and ideation since age 8. My gf thinks i’ve had a major depressive disorder my whole life, but there’s no reason for it. My parents aren’t abusive, i was never traumatised, i wasn’t bullied. 

I don’t have opinions, or wants. I can’t make decisions for myself when there is no clearly defined objective answer. I just echoed the opinions of my parents when i was a child, then the opinions of my friends in middle school, then of my girlfriend in high school, and now i’m here, echoing sensible philosophical arguments. I can’t even play videogames properly: i’m 700 hours into baldur’s gate 3 and i haven’t even left act 1, because i get too anxious about every decision i make to want to progress further.

I’m studying a degree to become an engineer. I decided to become an engineer when i was 13, i didn’t know what an engineer was but i didn’t want to get to a point in my life where i didn’t know what i was doing with myself. And maths/physics were simple enough to me. I was always good in school, but i couldn’t really do classes like English without teachers forcing me in the right direction because i couldn’t understand how to actually do anything when there wasn’t a correct answer to give.

I was ostracised from everyone when i got to middle school because i kept echoing my parents’ conservative propaganda until no one wanted to associate with me. It was during this time i had one of my worst depressive episodes, which i came out of asexual, for fear that no woman could ever love me.

Feeling depressive and alone is a feeling i seam to actively seek and act upon. Every time i think about an embarrassing memory i want to bludgeon my own head in. Doing things outside of my comfort zone brings me real mental pain, and failing at things i care about makes me feel suicidal, and if i didn’t care about it in the first place, i’ve already failed.

I cannot force myself to concentrate or compromise my wants for my needs. I can’t budget, sit still or stop my mind from wandering. I can’t even mope around or let the depression sink in because i’m too dopey to pay attention even to that. I forget that people hate me even while i’m arguing with them. And every social interaction i have, i only ever aim to placate them. I don’t have wants or opinions. Every conversation feels like im just trying to please them, its exhausting. I don’t want to be judged, ignored, or disliked by those i care about. 

I don’t feel in control of myself. And i don’t know what to do. I’m lucky i have my girlfriend, who is extremely considerate of my damages. Doesn’t expect sex from me, helps me make decisions when i cannot.

I don’t have any obsession with perfection with most things, but if i do it must absolutely be done the correct way, and if i don’t know what the correct way is, i will spend days planning before even attempting the most mundane of tasks.

What am i meant to do with myself. I live in self pity i don’t really want to go away, i think the only reason i’m alive is because of how quickly my attention shifts away from my major depressive moods. I don’t want to go through with suicide, but i yearn not to live in the anguish too. I don’t feel as though i actually truly exist.

1jfq4xp,1742480801.0,"Pathetic Excuse Of A Life I came across a post that helped me out into words what I actually felt...that Helped me describe the pathetic excuse of life I have, I am sharing the same with you all.

I know, i should just give up, i haven't been able to figure out anything in the last 25 years, So i doubt that I can now...but against all hope if you think, that there is a way of this ditch that my family has thrown me into, I will appreciate it..!!

So here goes nothing :

""
I don’t know why I’m writing this. Maybe just to get it out of my head, to dump it somewhere so it stops eating me alive. Not that it ever really stops.

I feel alone. When people don’t reach out, I get upset. When they do, I can’t bring myself to respond. Reaching out first feels exhausting. And when I do make plans, I regret it immediately. The panic sets in. The overthinking. The certainty that something will go wrong. So I cancel. Again. Then I lie in bed, hating myself for it. Again. The cycle repeats.

And then I wonder why I feel so damn alone.

I know people have their own lives. I can’t expect them to keep trying. I wouldn’t even know what to do if they did.

I want to change. But here? Mental health is a joke. Either you’re “overthinking,” or you’re completely out of your mind. No middle ground. No space to just struggle and try to work through it.

I’ve been carrying this since I was a kid. Self-harm at ten. Suicide attempts after that. More than I can count. My parents’ solution? One psychiatrist visit. He wrote a prescription, sent me to a psychologist, and that was it.

Therapy helped—until it didn’t. Until I realized I’d spent my life believing every bad thing that happened was my fault. When I was five, my grandfather died. He had asthma. My father’s sisters told me—told a five-year-old—that I exhausted him, pushed him too hard, and killed him.

When my psychologist suggested a family session, my family shut it down. I never went back. My meds ran out. That was that.

At 16, I was left to figure it out alone. So I did. Alcohol. Opioids. Benzos. Anything to shut it all off.

By 24, my parents retired. Broke. They spent everything on my aunts’ daughters' weddings—the same aunts who once blamed a child for a death. My siblings moved on. I was left behind, taking care of my parents because someone had to.

Now I’m 30. I provide for them, and I’m grateful I can. But I’m barely holding myself together.

I had one real relationship. It’s long gone. The friends who kept me sane drifted away, and I let them—because I couldn’t keep up. I tell myself I should try again—make new friends, meet someone, start over. But deep down, I know I’d just ruin it. I don’t even trust myself with myself, let alone with someone else.

So this is it. I work. I take care of my parents. And I sit here, imagining a different life. One where I don’t feel like this all the time. One where connection doesn’t feel impossible. But that’s just a fantasy. Because in my head, people understand. They care.

And out here?

I don’t think they do.

Fast forward to 2025, and my mother has been going through a depressive episode, seeing a therapist every week, overwhelmed with work and no longer talks to my father.

People make mistakes in their health, career and marriage every day, despite knowing how bad these mistakes are” which is a clear slight against my father for cheating all those years ago.

She asked me to take him for a while so she and her husband could get respite and at the end of that time, she told me she's not taking him back.  She only had him for 10 months and during that time, I offered two week respites twice. She won't even consider shared care or even giving me a break, knowing that I will have this huge responsibility for years, because he does not have the means for a nursing home setting and does not qualify for government assistance. He is stuck in the middle. This situation will last until his situation declines severely. Right now, that could be up to 3-4 years. We will have means to place him in a memory care facility for only one year. Until then, my life will revolve around his. 

Needless to say, I am severely depressed knowing that my life is essentially over until he is gone. Sometimes I even wish I was dead or that my sister was for doing this to me. I am so severely unhappy. I am outraged. I am a nervous wreck. I can barely keep it together, cry a lot, and I am having trouble concentrating. I can't snap out of it.

If someone has the same I can just encourage you to do the things you really want to do and ignore the fear, it sucks in the beginning, it wont feel good in the moment BUT oh boy it changes you over time. It took me years and then taking big steps I was very afraid of and for the first time in my life I can really say I don't have panic attacks anymore (besides feeling it sometimes a bit), im much more self confident around people, I'm not really ""happy"" but I'm also not sad or feel bad anymore which in my head is the only thing that counts. It feels like I was finally able to rewire my brain in the past 2-5 years. (And I had active panic attacks for the past 3-4 years).

I can just say if you have this problem, not avoiding it is the best thing you can do. (For me not everyone) it helped more than the medication I got before and I feel like its here to stay. At least I hope it will stay like this.

Just here to report that most of my issues with mental health are almost gone and life feels much different again, I know most people here who ""heal"" won't report it cause you mostly go on reddit to get help or understanding when its really bad.

It ""just"" takes time and effort (which I know can be really hard), and yes maybe its not the way for everyone I get that, but I would guess alot of people with the same issues as me would benefit from it.

I just wanted to take a moment to remind anyone struggling that you’re not alone. Mental health challenges can feel isolating, but there are people who genuinely care and want to support you. Whether you’re dealing with anxiety, depression, stress, or just feeling overwhelmed, it’s okay to reach out.

If you ever need a safe space to talk, there’s an app called **Kuky** that connects people going through similar struggles. It’s a judgment-free platform where you can share your thoughts, find companionship, and talk with others who truly understand. Sometimes, just having someone to listen can make a difference.

Take things one day at a time. You are valued, you matter, and you deserve support. 💙

1jfmzyl,1742471206.0,"Please help- I need resources I have been struggling with my mental health my whole life, at least as long as I can remember.
To sum it up, I have a plethora of diagnoses. I have been diagnosed with general anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder with major depressive episodes, ADHD, & I have received a “cautious” BPD diagnosis. So that is not a 100% thing, the results were a little wonky. I also have the MTFHR gene mutation- which apparently can affect mental health pretty often & it is thought to be the reason why I now have so many mental illnesses, as I did not know about this or take any supplements up until about a year ago. (I’m 24).
Basically over the past year my mental health has gotten significantly worse. I’m not sure if anyone here works in veterinary medicine or animal welfare, but if you do, you know how hard it can get. Unfortunately I had 2 back to back very toxic workplaces that put me into survival mode & I have been burnt out for a while. I’ve never experienced such pain & resentment for the field that I once loved so much.. & even then I can’t leave it. 
I recently started a new job where everyone is so kind & it seems like such a healthy environment… but my body is still not accepting that. I also recently went through a break up that really hit hard & I’ve been feeling really alone, so all of this all together is just hard. 
Every morning I wake up vomiting, crying, in a panic, & just physically all around feel awful. It’s getting to the point where I’m starting to get suicidal, which I haven’t truly been in a while. It just feels so stupid to struggle so hard just to get up at this big age. I feel like such a disappointment & a bum & like I’m failing everyone, including myself. My mom texts me saying I’m being too quiet, & I’m like yea… because I don’t want to burden you with my sadness. She also isn’t a super empathetic person & would tell me I need to get it together because I need money. Which I know. 
Today I had to call myself out & tell the manager I need to get some help. The issue is, I do not have health insurance at the moment since I just started this job, & I am off my meds. Not that they ever seemed to make a difference in the first place. I’m at a point where I’m thinking that medication is not the answer for me & that I have some deep rooted issues I need to figure out.
I just don’t know what to do. I don’t have the money to pay for therapy out of pocket. I want to apply for Medicare but I’m not sure how long that will take or if I’ll even qualify.

I used to get burnt out during each semester of lawschool but still managed to push on with internships and other co-curricular activities. 

However, I completely fumbled my first job; I got massive anxiety attacks while on the job, and in the aftermath, my cognitive abilities including attention span, reading comprehension, working memory, etc declined.

Sometimes I worry that somebody can see me in the bath through a hidden camera. When I hear a song I think that my brain is creating the music and that it is displaying or “programming” my thoughts. That somehow I am behind everyone else in the 3D world and they have reached enlightenment, that I need to “wake up”. I am not religious. I don’t do any substances. When I’m outside in the dark, I can see the shadows forming and it looks like my cat running through a yard. I convince myself that it’s true, that if I don’t believe it’s real my cat won’t come home. I’m exhausted. I cry almost every night being so overwhelmed. I can’t get enough sleep anymore, and when I do get “good” sleep it’s well over 8 hours and I’m still so tired. I’ll close my eyes and see those shapes of white in the dark and think that it’s the “truth”, “home” whatever. I think that dreams are taking me somewhere else. A lot of things feel like a sign.

Honestly the best way to describe me is a gooner (is that what people call it?)

 I m@$trubate every time I feel like crap. Which is most of the time. But after doing… that, it makes me feel horrible. I’m so desperate to stop but I don’t know how. 

I feel like I’m being held together by glue and prayers. I feel so disgusting and horrible every day, and with this country (I live in the states) getting worse every single day, it just makes me want to stop trying at all. 

Honestly I feel like I’m beyond saving, like I’m so disgusting and horrible that I can’t be saved. But at the same time I want so desperately to get better.

I wanna feel better about myself. The days I do feel good about myself I notice something wrong about myself. Whether it’s that I shaved wrong, my hair is knotted, I forgot to put deodorant on, etc. And then I feel stuck again.

On bad days I wonder if I should just end it, if it would be better to just let go entirely. But as always I’m too much of a pussy to go through with it. 

I don’t shower regularly, I don’t wash my clothes or bedsheets regularly, I’m addicted to 🌽 and I just don’t know what to do anymore.

I can’t talk to my mom because whatever I say she’ll trust be like, “Oh so that’s my fault?”, “You’re just depressed, it’ll pass.”, “Maybe you’re just like this.”, or “Why don’t you just stop.”

My dad abandoned me at four years old so I can’t talk to him. Honestly all of this 🌽 made me start normalizing the most disgusting things like 🍇 or SA, and I hate it, I hate having those thoughts.

Sometimes I get violent thoughts too. Like when my mom is yelling at me again (she does that a lot) I get these thoughts like, what if I just grabbed a knife and stabbed her. And it scares me, it scares me that I could have these thoughts and feelings.

I’m just stuck right now, I’ve been like this since I was 11, I just want some help. Maybe some tips on how to get into a habit of good hygiene? Or how to get clean from my 🌽 addiction?

Here's the thing, I'm doing better currently I don't feel I'm that deep into depression and there have been gigantic changes, starting martial arts, a new hobby, getting my driver's license and being more stable mentally although I have my lows every month, I thought it had something to do with my menstrual cycle but those lows/blues don't match with any part of my menst. cycle phases so idk whats going on.

Besides those lows I feel overwhelmed/burnt out easily and get tired and discouraged easily, for example, I started doing MA in October and I haven't attended since February because I feel so unmotivated, I don't drive my car alone because I'm anxious and overthink about parking, but if I'm accompanied by anyone driving I can normally drive like its cake. Im quite lonely, don't have many friends I'm trying to work on it but currently, I'm quite alone.

I feel helpless and hopeless and unmotivated, every time I get excited about anything my motivation is short-lived, sometimes I have energy rushes when I start working out/exercising and I'm super motivated, clean the house, prepare plans for a healthy diet and it's like I'm about to start a routine and then pufff down again, I also have this physical feeling of heaviness in my legs, like when you take a hot bath or spend too much time in a pool, and get out of the water and your legs feel heavy af, well I have that feeling constantly through my body its like a mix of heaviness and weakness (idk if its allowed, but if anyone thinks its a medical condition and you can say it please say it so I can get checked for that specifically because doctors tend to dismiss symptoms where I live, which also discourages my from going to an appointment, I have been checked previously and dismissed) 

I also started gaining weight I'm not even obese but I'm starting to get chunky, clothes now feel uncomfortable, I tend to binge eat and it's making me even sadder.I don't even know if its actual weight or bloating.

I don't have any motivation partially because every time I pour my heart into a project I never see any results. If there is, every single time it benefits anyone but me (yeah people take advantage of me every time I work my ass off for something), so my motivation usually is short-lived as I constantly remember and feel like I do everything in vain so why bother.

I don't know what to do I feel like a stupid parasite,I cant keep up with a routine or anything and that heavines sensation is awful, is like gravity is calling my ass to sit down and do nothing. Also, the feeling of loneliness is dreading.

1jfg6hf,1742442340.0,"My friend is hopelessly depressed and only has me to rely on. I feel like he's not trying and I can't handle it anymore. What do I do? I *really* need help and advice here. I know this is quite long, so if you read it, thankyou so much.

I (29F) love my friend (29M) but I can't handle his hopelessness anymore, and I'm starting to feel really resentful towards him (which makes me feel horribly guilty). We've been friends for 9 years, throughout which he has struggled with depression and trauma. I have too, deeply, so I get it, and through hard work I have healed a lot. I've always been there to support him, but over the last year he has cut off almost all his friends, and now solely relies on me for social connection and support. I'm the only person he trusts and talks to honestly, and he felt like none of his other friends really understood him, which he was very resentful about. I can't help thinking, of course they didn't understand him, because he didn't open up to them, and this is a kind of self-fulfilling prophecy of isolation. 

  
He is very, very set in the belief that happiness and connection are impossible for him, and that he shouldn't have to try or hope for a happy life. About a year ago, we were living together, and I felt like I was the only thing that made him happy and that he was codependently relying on me to be his life buoy. We argued, and I told him he needed to prioritise his own happiness in order to heal. He replied that not caring about his own happiness is fundamental to who he is, and issued an ultimatum: if I wanted to be his friend, I had to accept that about him. I didn't want to stop being friends - I really care about him, and honestly, I was worried about how he would cope without me - but after a year of accepting these terms, I feel completely exhausted, hopeless, burdened and (recently) really angry with him. 

I don't live with him anymore but I am still the only person he is really friends with. He lives alone and is making no effort to make friends or go to therapy. He finds logical reasons to justify these things, but I can't help but think he just doesn't want to face the fear, shame, vulnerability and possible rejection/failure that may come with trying to build himself a good life/community and working on himself and his unresolved trauma.

  
I've been trying to set boundaries with him, only giving what I can give etc, but last week I reached my breaking point. He told me that he will never be able to be happy and that connection is simply not possible for him - as if depression and isolation are his identity. Later he asked to move in with me, because it would be good for *his* mental health, assuming I'd say yes and without even considering how I would feel. Suddenly, I was completely furious. I feel like he feels so entitled to codependently rely on me, and thinks that as long as he has me he can cope with the rest of his life being incredibly hopeless and miserable. He doesn't seem to consider or care about the impact this has on me, though I have told him before how stressed and grieved I am over his refusal to seek help. I can't stop being angry, and at this point what I actually want is not to see him anymore. I feel like his reliance on me is holding him back and frankly I'm just sick of it.

I (19M) feel like I have been stuck in a chronic depression of moderate intensity since September of 2020. While I was always 100% functional, I was always bored and my thoughts were negative.  However, I am on vacations at my grandparent's house and realized something. 

I just need to stop being online, and the depression I have been stuck in for nearly 5 years will go away. Since the beggining of the pandemic, I took the habit of being on YouTube and reddit a lot more than I was before. This leaves me bored and seeking negative content, and yet addicted due to the intensity of what can be found online. 

The thing that made it click is that due to being at my grandparent's house, I spend a lot more time walking outside and socializing compared to my usual schedule, which is 100% video games and social media. The negative thoughts are almost gone. Boredom is temporary, and it allows me to relax. Even then, it is mostly linked to the little time I spend on my laptop. 

I remember that for the new year of 2024, I was in vacation and walking all the time, barely touching any screen. I remember this as being one of the few times I felt happy.

1jf00fd,1742399028.0,"I feel like I’m faking and forcing myself to be mentally ill for attention. 

I wouldn’t say I’m mentally healthy, but to be honest, I’ve never been diagnosed with anything (cuz mental health is pretty much not an important thing in my family). I do have bad times where I feel lonely, sad or even depressed, but not to the extent to be mentally ill people who need to go to therapies or get any treatments. But sometimes I feel like I choose to be this way. Sometimes when Im happy, it feels pretty strange, and I start to think negatively and decide to feel bad again in a few hours, that’s where I feel “normal”.

I was thinking maybe it’s the social media, I’ve seen too many people romanticizing mental illnesses. Makes me think that people would care about you more when you tell them that you’re mentally sick (although I tend to push people away when I’m not well), that’s the weird thing, I want people to care about me but also don’t. 

I know I’m an attention seeker from a young age. When I think back to when I was younger, I wonder if I’ve always craved attention. I used to do things at school on purpose to get myself bullied, to get sympathy or attention from my parents, I really enjoyed it when they comforted me. When I was a kid, I also tried to hurt myself a few times when I was fighting with my mother so she would stop and told me to stop and hugged me. Now, it feels like that pattern still shows up, but in a less obvious way. As I got older, I still want people’s attention, however, I’m afraid to actually seek attention, therefore don’t get any.

Maybe it’s just my personality, “attention seeker”. I know there’re a lot that I can do to boost my mood, but I’m not willing to do it. And I know what triggers my bad mood but still do it. idk why I do this all the time.

1jfaqxi,1742426000.0,"Rant ig idrk 16F. Hi this is my first post here. I’m a sophomore in high school. I’ve been struggling a lot lately but I honestly don’t know why? I’ve been struggling a ton lately with my body image and nothing makes me feel more insane than when someone is like “noo you’re not fat you’re beautiful.” Like thank you but I don’t see myself that way and you saying that doesn’t make it better. I’ve also been extremely stressed with school. My grades are honestly not as bad as they were in middle school or freshman year. I have all 80 and above but in my foreign language class I’m failing and grades close on Friday. I know if I fail, I’ll probably get screamed at and have everything taken away from me. I keep joking around saying it’s “the winter depression” and that it’ll go away soon, but it never does. I’m extremely stressed about college because I don’t think I have good enough grades to get scholarships, and my mom has made it clear I’m on my own money-wise for college. And on top of all my school stress, I’ve just lost all of my motivation. I don’t find joy in anything I used to do. I don’t hang out with my friends anymore, I don’t go shopping because I can’t even look at myself in the mirror, I don’t go to my favorite restaurants because I’m horrified I’ll see someone I know from school or my old school. My mom is just a pos half the time. Like yesterday I got into the car and I was like “my day was bad,” and she was like “well mine was worse.” Just small things like that just make life feel so much harder to live. We went to pick up my little sister after that and I screamed at my sister and I hit my mom. For context, my sister is 9 and was screaming because my mom didn’t get her a snack or something. I told her to stop crying and start acting her age because all my mom does is baby her. So I went to whack her foot, not even hard, and my mom raised her hand to idk what to me, but I slapped her arm away from me. I’m not a violent person, but sometimes I feel like all control leaves my body. After that, we went home, I didn’t talk to anyone for three hours, I took a nap, and then I ate food after.

1jeyg2f,1742394968.0,"addicted to the news and it’s ruining me I initially subscribed to political channels and started looking at the news daily as a way to ground myself and stay informed so I didn’t (ironically) spiral with all that’s going on. But now I can’t help but refresh my youtube homepage or whatever news app multiple times a day, hoping for good news and only getting worse and worse updates. 

Like last Friday, my day off, I spent the whole day switching from youtube to reddit to twitter (god forbid). That spewed into Saturday where I had to call out of work because I was still in that same state of extreme despair and depression to where I could not stop crying. Sunday, I go into work and keep tearing up, even cried in the bathroom. Luckily I open the store by myself so that’s when I cried and teared up the most. Work went well for the rest of the day, but whenever I’d go on my breaks or be left alone I’d immediately go back to that state. I even couldn’t help checking youtube/news on my phone during work. 

Yesterday (tuesday) was my day off and I spent it once again in that state, save for my therapy appointment which was all about that. And today I’ve spent every moment since I woke up refreshing and trying to see if there’s any hope at all. I don’t even watch the videos anymore, I’ll just watch a few seconds and refresh again. It’s concerning to me even though I’m the one doing it. I deleted twitter and I even tried to make a new youtube with the regular content I used to watch, but I even started watching some political stuff on that account without realizing. I kept my main youtube, and it’s scary seeing my homepage and history just filled with different news channels and podcasts.

 My mind is going crazy, I’m worried about my parents and when they hit retirement age if they’ll even be able to live somewhat comfortably, I’m worried about how I’m going to live at all beyond working in retail and living at home. I’m worried about my dad, if he loses his job we’ll probably be homeless and even now I don’t even want to eat because groceries are so expensive. I’m scared just being a WOC. Everyone says to focus on what you can control and not to wait for the sad thing to happen, but I just can’t. I feel so sick knowing that everything is getting worse and everything is unpredictable. I’m stuck in this state of hopelessness and I hate that I feel this way. Worrying about money, thinking of how worried my parents must be about money, thinking of how there are others suffering more than us. Everything makes me cry these days and I’m so tired of crying, but I don’t want to go through life beaten down and emotionless even though I’m kinda wishing I didn’t feel emotional about anything atp.

1jf8b99,1742419615.0,"Stuck in a cage Figured that title might get clicks lol but I feel like I'm stuck in a cage metaphorically. I have been trying for disability since 2022. This is my 2nd try and my final hearing is at the end of this month. I never wanted this life but my mental health (adhd, bipolar) is so severe I can't function and I gave up trying.

I am 32yo male and I still cannot accept the fact that this might be my life and it won't get better. We don't have a cure just meds that keep us on the other side of that danger line. My perfect life is a modest house along a lake with a 2 car garage and jet skis and a family. Instead I have never lived alone, no longer own a car, divorced since 2015 and nothing serious since, craving that love and affection from a woman, have a 10 year old daughter who I have had to explain several times over the years why her dad doesn't work or has panic attacks and functions at the level of a teen after a high school day. By that I mean I lay in bed and watch twitch or YouTube or play games on the pc. Everyone I know is so far past me in life and these people my age you see online have a house of their own and doing things like building fire pits in their backyard and going on vacations and just adulting and I'm no better off or even further ahead in life then I was when I graduated high school in 2011. It's like a jail cell and I can see through the bars everyone living life and I don't understand why I can't have that. Why am I different? I get so depressed thinking about it. These meds and a therapist don't bring me down to their level of functioning and idk why.

I was feeling ok until my long time gamer friend who lives in another state messaged me yesterday. We met when I was high school and have games ever since until the last few years where his life is taking off and he's going to Japan to visit and he's gonna propose to his gf. I was happy for him but he has passed me in life so far and he's 6 years younger then me. Now I can't shake the depression and thoughts of how awful my life is and how I want to scream cause I don't have a solution to be like these normal people. I don't see a way out just a means to exist but get nothing I dreamed of having. The thought of never having love again due to my issues is difficult to bear. My love language is touch like cuddling and the stroke of an arm or hand or something it puts me at such peace that no med has ever given me and I'm deprived of that for many years and no amount of dating apps has changed that. Few matches and everything is monetized and very expensive and the ones you do match don't reply or they ghost in a few days for no apparent reason. Not to mention the insane amount of bot accounts.

1jf7cgr,1742417187.0,"Feeling invisible I can't believe im writing on reddit, but here we are. My whole life Ive had to work so darn hard to be noticed, and it's really starting to catch up to me. I know this seems like a ""oh feel sorry for me"" kind of post, and in some degree, maybe it is, but i totally understand if its annoying and ""too much"". I get it. Just ignore it, lol, im just having a silly little breakdown over this.

I'm brought up as a middle child in a family with a traumatized mother and a somewhat emotional avoidant father. She has lots of trauma which she's never really processed, and my whole life she's just been either 1, too stressed to cope with other's feelings, or 2. too depressed to notice im even present. Which is alright i guess, because I knew she was doing her best.

Then we have my father who grew up with a psychiatrist as a father (my grandpa) who always wanted to talk through every single emotion and thought that entered my father's head, leading to him completely blocking of anything that reminds him of mental health or psychology. Now he leaves the room if any of us get stressed or emotional.

Then we have middle school. I was in a girls group that based their humor on making fun of others. My friend's eczema was a common subject of entertainment, as well as the disabled kid in our class who had trouble walking. At one point in fifth grade, I apparently spent too much time with one of the popular girls in the group, and the others got so jealous they poisoned my food with random pills they found in their parents closet. At least they acknowledged my existence right?

Oh, and I never ever talked in class, but i nearly failed at everything because I couldnt focus and I hated asking for help so I pretended everything was okay. And yes, I could have done more to get help, I'm not disputing that, but oh my god I wish the teachers would see past the noisy kids in the class for once and actually see me!! Just once!

As a teen I spent every single day at school alone. I sat alone at lunch, i escaped any social interactions because i felt so shameful everytime I talked. I tried, I promise, but whatever I said fell on deaf ears, and I never really understood the social codes.

I somehow managed to get a boyfriend from an external martial arts class at the age of 16, but after dating for two years his mom threatened to kill herself if he didnt break up with me. I was apparently the devil because I wasn't from the same culture or religion as their family (they were very conservative). We loved eachother, but we had to cut ties. Well, I did so he could save his family relations, but what do I know, maybe I just use that as an excuse and I was just too scared and weak to fight for it. I still don't know!

Now I work at a bar, and ive worked there for two years. Today my boss expressed genuine surprise by the fact I could speak norwegian fluently. I am norwegian. She genuinely didn't know my nationality. She has never asked me a single personal question since my first day back in 2023 and I know her entire backstory because I ASK QUESTIONS.

I feel like ive been invisible my entire life, and I don't understand what ive been doing wrong. Am i that fucking insignificant??

My bedsheet (yes, only one. I don't know where the non‐fitted one ran off to) is tattered and old and disgusting and it's been that way for probably over a year but because of my apparent inability to be self-sufficient, I refused to change it.

I had convinced myself that in order to get rid of it I needed to take a picture of it (a very old habit of mine) and I'd simply never gotten around to doing that. Well today I got off my ass and took as many goddamn pictures of my bed and room as I wanted, then changed the sheet to a new set I had lying around.

And oh my god it feels so good to get that over with. Who knew that doing something so simple that I was too depressed to do for months would be so rewarding? I'm hoping this will be the first of many wins and that I won't stop here.

1jeubej,1742381988.0,"Maybe we're not actually ""tired"" all the time, we simply have types of stress and emotions we can't identify, because we spent our developmental years hearing adults tell us that we were tired almost every time we got really overwhelmed or built up. I get in a certain state often as an adult. Is not really tiredness but it's a daze.  I find myself  in a state where I have these feelings I can't identify.  I have begun to realize that during this state i have things going on in the background, whether bad or just unfamiliar/requiring time. 

Often I feel unsatisfied about something, or I feel loaded and I'm not sure what to do. Often it's a form of excitement or anxiety. Something builds and the response is to just resort to ""I'm tired"" or “I'm too tired for this”. There's a good chance I actually slept well, and 9 times out of 10 laying down fixes nothing, coffee and water and food does nothing.

 I'm ""tired"" when I have feelings or issues I don't know how to fix running in the background. 

 I relate so hard when I take care of a child or see an older family member's child reach the breaking point. Sometimes it is just an attitude or exhaustion, but too often the child has valid reasons to be upset or is overloaded or has had issues building up all day and just doesn't know what to do. The parent will slap the sleep bandaid on, like ""oh yeah, you're tired"" ""he's super tired today"" ""oh yeah, it's your bedtime"" yet half or more of the time, the kid actually got decent sleep or had a good nap just a few hours ago, or it's still 2 or 3 hours until bedtime and the child has been having a bad day piling up with no support (even unintentionally from the parents). 

I feel like parents project extreme tiredness on a child constantly and it's a tool to avoid the big mess that is going on with the idea of “get through the day”, or it's a thing to take advantage of to end the day early. I see relatives taking advantage of this almost every single day, and  putting an upset child in bed at a random hour or letting them cry until they're tired enough to sleep, so the parents can go drink or play a game. My parents did this to me often from day one especially 2 until I think 2nd grade. I remember even l as a teenager, when I got frustrated about something whether it was petty or serious, I was told “you need to go back to bed” even though I got over 8 hours the night before or this situation was before or just after dinner.

1jf4bem,1742409746.0,"How a surfing accident sparked my battle with anxiety and what helped me In 2017, what was supposed to be a relaxing surfing trip to Sri Lanka turned into the beginning of a two-year battle with anxiety and depression. One morning, I hit my foot on an underwater stone while surfing. At first, it seemed like a minor bruise, but the warm, humid climate slowed the healing, and it developed into a severe infection.

When I got back home, I could barely walk without pain. After months of antibiotics and treatments, the infection finally healed—but by then, anxiety and depression had taken over. I started experiencing constant shortness of breath and heart palpitations, even during light exercise. I spent countless hours in doctor’s offices, undergoing tests, but was always told I was “fine.”

I’ll never forget the worst moments—lying awake at night, convinced I was having a heart attack, rushing to the ER only to hear the same thing: “Your heart is fine.” The fear didn’t go away, and I felt more trapped than ever.

For nearly two years, I struggled to find answers and solutions. Medications didn’t help me. In fact, they just made things worse and left me feeling numb and brain-fogged.

It took time and a lot of adjustments, but I eventually managed to completely overcome anxiety and depression. It’s been more than 5 years now, and I’m feeling better than ever. I still vividly remember the incredible moment when my natural serotonin production restarted after gradually coming off the meds. I began waking up happy and energised instead of totally depressed and exhausted. Even simple things, like listening to music, gave me happy tingles I hadn’t felt in years.

Looking back, I realised how much faster I could have recovered if I’d had the right knowledge from the start. One of the main turning points for me was recognising the importance of my gut microbiome and how it impacted my mental state. This led me to methods for uncovering and tackling the deeper causes of my anxiety—not just managing the symptoms.  Understanding how my anxiety triggers worked and learning to neutralise them gave me the clarity and tools I needed to finally move forward.

As I got better, I started noticing more and more TikTok and Instagram videos about anxiety, and what struck me the most were the comment sections. So many people were sharing their struggles—describing their debilitating anxiety symptoms, and expressing how lost they felt in finding answers. It reminded me so much of my own painful journey and made me think that perhaps I should compile my insights and share what helped me recover.

So I decided to team up with clinical psychologists and make an app that I wish I had when my anxiety & depression kicked in. The goal is to help others avoid the trial-and-error I went through and provide tools to manage anxiety that are based in the latest research.

I just launched the app on App Store and if any of this resonates with you and you’d like to know more, let me know (not sure if sharing a link here is okay, but the app is called Calmer). I’d be happy to share more about what I’m building and would appreciate your feedback.

What’s your experience with anxiety and depression? Is there anyone else here who’s also found a way to fully recover and what helped you?

Id just moved from my friends, i got really anxious and depressed and isolated myself into a hole it seems. When I re entered the world I was met with excruciating anxiety and very little acceptance from my peers, no one really wanted to talk to me outside of the day I showed up to my new school and people made fun of me in front of my face after..I guess, pretending to like me. It doesn't help that I am also extremely introverted and have a crazy low social battery and durring my period of isolation I went through alot that made it hard to live everyday life.(not goung into detail) No one I meet ever seems to have anything in common with me, I'm horrible at parties and don't really like them (people expect alot it feels like, but what they expect is basic conversation and i guess the want to have fun, which is hard when your scared.) Sense i was 12 I've had this plan to kill myself when I turned 18 and now i've made it and it feels like there's nothing for me.  When I talk to people it's excruciating and I'm horribly anxious, and when I'm not i usually have little to nothing to talk about and usually want to be alone anyway. But I crave companionship so bad, just someone who likes what I like and who wants me to be there, someone who feels nice to be around and who I know won't judge me for what I lack. Or even who's just patient enough to give me some confidence to talk. But I dont know how I can get to this point with anyone when the whole time I talk to people it just feels awful. I haven't  been able to get a job, i literally can't even talk to cashiers or receptionists without panicking. I can't talk to MY OWN FAMILY sometimes because I'm so anxious conversationally. I'm so scared for my future because I don't know if I'm ever gonna be able to do anything with my life and be happy/ not anxious all the fucking time. When I went back to school it was excruciating and I wanted to die so bad, and believe me I TRIED. I dont know where to go or what to do with myself, I'm very happy outside of this issue and I don't know what to do about it. I just want to feel and live normally, as normally as I can.

They‘re not in a mindset where they’re able to think a lot about their own mental health unassisted without breaking down, so whenever I ask them how I could be there more they also don’t know.

1jf1zpz,1742404008.0,"I finally found mental peace after years of task anxiety (sharing my journey) Hey everyone, I've been somewhat active on this sub for ages but felt compelled to put together a post. For the longest time, I was the person with 50+ tabs open, 200+ unread emails, and a to-do list that made me physically nauseous whenever I looked at it. My anxiety around tasks got so bad that I'd literally get heart palpitations when someone asked ""hey, did you finish that thing?"" (spoiler: I usually hadn't) The cycle was brutal:

* Feel overwhelmed
* Procrastinate because of anxiety
* Feel MORE anxious because I'm procrastinating
* Hide from my responsibilities
* Repeat until mental breakdown

Three months ago, I hit a wall. After a particularly embarrassing missed deadline at work that I couldn't hide, I realized something had to change. But willpower and ""trying harder"" wasn't cutting it. What finally clicked for me was understanding that my approach to task management was actually CAUSING my anxiety, not just revealing it. I needed a system that worked WITH my brain instead of against it. I actually documented my entire journey and the solutions I found in [an article I wrote about Todoist best practices](https://baizaar.tools/todoist-best-practices-stop-missing-deadlines-finally-get-stuff-done/) . Writing it helped me process everything I'd learned, and I figured it might help others struggling with the same issues. The big lightbulb moments for me were:

* Stop keeping tasks in my head (where they torture me)
* Break down overwhelming projects into tiny next actions
* Have a regular ""review"" time where I look at everything
* Create a ""today only"" focus that feels doable

The mental health benefits have been genuinely life-changing. That constant background hum of anxiety is just... gone. I sleep better. I'm more present with my family. I actually enjoy my work again. I'm not saying Todoist specifically is the magic bullet (though it's working great for me), but having SOME trusted system outside your head seems to be the key.

Has anyone else discovered this connection between mental health and task management? Or found other systems that helped with your task anxiety? Would love to hear what's working for others.

A few months ago, i started to feel tired and sad for nothing. In class i still listen and also get good grades, but i'm always feeling tired. I sleep badly, sometimes i wake up in night, i take around 30 minutes to 1 hour to sleep, the week end i wake up around 5-6 am. I feel guilty for some things i've done, even if it's small thing that i did when i was a child. Today i did something that wasn't really smart. I wanted to make a little joke to a girl that insult me sometimes (even if i didn't do anything) i oponed her bag and took an empty box of chewing-gum (remember, it was EMPTY). I put it in a garbage and then put it back in her bag. Someone that saw it told her and then the school staff yelled at me (also, the girl said that there was still 1 chewing-gum in the box, but i knew she lied, bcs when i asked to see, she didn't wanted). The staff said that she will tell to the CPE (sorry, i don't know the variant for english) and while the staff was yelling at me, the girl was smiling at me. I know it wasn't good, but to be honest, i don't think that she is an angel too for insulting and hitting me sometimes. I started to have dark thoughts, i've searched on google some depression signs, and i had a few of them:

-tired 24/24, even if i eventually slept well
-i sleep really bad, i sleep at 21 pm and i take around 30 minutes to sleep (as ive mentioned before)
-i still concentrate in class, but it's getting hard
-i have some muscle pain around the neck
-i like to draw, and do 2D animations. But since a while, i don't draw much.

I don't know if i'm really in depression, because there's some fake depressed peoples in our middle school that got one problem and immediatly started to say that they cut themselves etc.

Also, if this is part of the depression signs, one of the thing that traumatized me, was when my mom was confined and threatened by her partner, he didn't let her call for help. I was in my room and i heard everything.

1jf14m6,1742401858.0,"Does your city (or its design) affect your mental health? Hi, lately I’ve been really interested in these questions as I suddenly became so aware of my environment and started to feel mixed emotions about how cities I’ve lived in are designed. Therefore, I’m taking a small qualitative research course in uni and decided to conduct my own research since I can’t find interviews with my exact reasoning.

Your answer will be anonymously used and overall I just want to know if other people feel like me.. So if you could answer these questions, it would really scratch my curiosity 🤞🏻

The research question is “how do people feel between densely built cities?”

1. Which city do you live in? Is there a reason you chose this place? (optional if you want to keep it secret)
2. Do you ever feel confined or overwhelmed by tall buildings, skyscrapers and narrow streets?  Or is there something else? 

For me I feel so claustrophobic lately, especially after moving to Finland. I crave nature and silence when I spend time in a crowded city for a bit too long. 

3. What do you love most about living in a dense urban environment? What keeps you here despite any challenges?

I used to live in New York, and I miss how diverse the streets were! You could always find something to do but honestly it started to feel stressful after a few years. Always something happening and I felt like I was always running behind on some unknown thing that I must catch up to. Even when streets are built to be narrow and close, it didn’t help my mental health, cuz the connections I made were pretty surface level ones.

4. If you could change one thing about the way your city is built, what would it be and why?
5. Have you noticed differences in how locals vs tourists experience your city?

My foreign friends who came into my town for a few days usually said that there is not much to do and a very calm place. However, I feel like this is one of the main reasons why the residents (including me) chose this place! You will find the underrated gem spots after living for a while, and you start to enjoy the peace that comes with the slow living. Now I feel so freeeeee and finally as if I am living on my own pace since even the buildings are not that tall and i can see the (rare for now) sunshine and the sky.

6. How does your city’s design impact your daily routines or social interaction?

If you have any other insights, please share! I am so passionate about this topic!

1jf0zsy,1742401523.0,"Can't recover because of my environment I have severe OCD and possibly Schizophrenia and my environment is literally making it impossible to recover. My OCD isn't the germophobic sort, it's the kind where I have to do compulsions all day to stop bad shit from happening and obsess over it all day. On top of that, I suffer from heavy delusions and hallucinations and extreme anxiety and paranoia. I can't catch a break and am always bombarded by triggers, intrusive thoughts, compulsions, obsessions, and everything else.

But I live with my grandmother (no, not the innocent old lady sort. The bitter middle-fucking-aged kind.) and she's the most dumbass annoying triggering mother fucker there is. I've cried to her almost a million fucking times and each time she acts like she cares then forgets everything I said the next day. She does things that trigger me without a care in the world and sits there watching the news for hours on end to the point that if I talk to her while she's watching it she gets mad and flat-out ignores me, even if I'm at my breaking point.

Every damn day I'm overwhelmed with anxiety, paranoia, and stress and feel like I'm splitting in half and dying alive and no one fucking cares or understands. My grandmother dismisses me, acts like I'm overreacting, and starts yelling if I break down telling me ""just ignore it"" (keep in mind she hasn't faced a day of anxiety in her mf life) as if it's even possible to ignore. She even says stuff she KNOWS affects me like ""if you keep thinking about bad things they WILL happen"" knowing I genuinely believe that and spend ages obsessing over it because I can't control my own head and mind. On top of that my mom and her husband have also moved in so now the house is more hectic.

So after finishing school I wanted to take a gap year because the program I did was extremely difficult and left me mentally and emotionally  drained. Throughout the progarm, I was constantly tired, and studying felt overwhelming, but I pushed myself through and managed to finish pretty well. But I was anxious and stressed all the time, and by the end of it, I was completely burned out, so yes I did want to take a gap year to work on my mental health but my parents had other plans, they wanted me to go to university and not sit around doing ""nothing"" so they signed me up to a university and I got in (although I didn't want to, but I tried because I did not want to disappoint them) so somewhat I did finish the first semester for them but now the second semester I can't do it anymore. 

I always had very bad anxiety but it has gotten so much worse to the point where j feel overwhelmed and nervous to go to the university lectures and practice works, because at the though of being surrounded by a lot of people, so I stopped going yo avoid this, my mum noticed thus and she started driving me to lectures to make sure I go. And it's not helping me at all, and there's no point in telling my parents that i struggle mentally because they are slavic so in their sense it's a whole lot of bullshit and they don't belive in this whole mental health stuff.

but something felt “missing”
i also felt emotionally detached from my relationships

1jey1o6,1742393892.0,"My sister's mental illness is sucking me and my family dry. TW: brief mention of suicidal ideations 

My sister was recently admitted to an inpatient hospital due to suicidal ideations. She was previously diagnosed with bipolar and has been dealing with alcoholism. However, she got evaluated and was redisgnosed to CPTSD, major depressive disorder, and anxiety. I dont fully trust the diagnosis, personally. The place abruptly took her off her medicine she's been on for two or so years now (antipsychotic, mood stabilizer, anxiety medication). And they prescribed her three new things (anxiety medicine, antipsychotic, and a medicine to help curb alcohol cravings). She ended up leaving two days before they wanted her to and is back home now. 

For the last several weeks she's been experiencing severe delusions. She takes everything as a ""sign"" and thinks she's going to hell. Numbers such as 911, 666, 111, etc bring her distress. So do ambulances, firetrucks, and anything related to death. Its brought her great distress. 

Me, my mom, and my sisters boyfriend have been doing everything in our power to be supportive and try to get her the help she needs. She refuses to help herself. We feel like we are making moves one moment, and the next it's like we made zero progress. She threatens suicide daily. My mom and my sisters boyfriends jobs are both on the line over this.

We take it all so seriously, but it's coming to a point to where we don't know what else to do. I am about to graduate in less than months with a 3.9 GPA that I have busted my ass for and this is starting to effect my schooling. Its effecting my mental health. I wake up fighting off a panic attack every morning now.  The situation is ruining the life of everyone that is close to her. Its exhausting. I am hoping when her medication balances out, her symptoms will stabilize.

Has anyone dealt with a situation similar to this and how did you keep your own sanity? Some days I just want to give up and move across the country. :( 



Tldr: my sisters severe mental illness is taxing. She is suicidal. She refuses to help herself despite everyone around her doing everything they can to help. It feels like a losing battle and we don't know what to do at this point. We are exhausted. Shes been through several abrupt medication changes which I think contributes to alot of it.

1jexuca,1742393351.0,"Always distressed Hello everyone. I would personally like to share my struggles in here, maybe help you feel better about yourself? I have no one to talk to at home so I'm reaching out to you guys. I am a 15 year old girl, if anyone's wondering (maybe this is the age shit starts idk) 

I would just like to share some of my experience since I'm literally about to burst. Back in 2022 (I was in 6th grade), I was at the top of my class, barely any absences, turn in my assignments, etc. For about the first 6 months of my new school year, I wasn't as good as when I was in 6th grade, but I was still a semi good student.

Then after that, I started to feel depressed, I don't exactly remember how it started but things went down hill after that... Now I'm in the 8th grade, yes, it didn't get better in fact, it got worst. I'm afraid I'm getting held back this year. For context, my aunt has a three story house, I'm at the third floor and my other aunt is at the ground floor with her dogs. I developed a fear of dogs because they can smell illnesses and shit, I'm scared that they might smell me because I developed some deadly disease or something. 

Yesterday, one of my aunt's dogs sniffed my leg and stood up trying to get my attention, this scared me to death because I was afraid I developed ♋ (sorry, I can't type it because if I even hear or see this word I would freak out) Whenever I come across this word, I'd freak out, cover my ears and knock repeatedly until I'm convinced that it won't happen to me or anyone I love. I haven't been able to go down to the main floor because my aunt's dogs are there and they legit scare me to death. 

I tried to tell my mom, she saw me cry, but instead of helping me, she got mad. She said that whenever I do these things (not my first panic attack or mental breakdown) that I stress her out. I cut my wrist when I'm distressed, not always now, but some triggers lead to it. My family doesn't believe in mental health, if someone they know has a mental illness they would call fem crazy/weirdo. Yes it hurts because I'm only 15, who else am I supposed to talk to but my own family? I did have delusions that I was meant to be a superhero or that every green animal/insect that follows me is beast boy from Teen Titans because I'm actually chosen to be a superhero.

 I never told anyone that, but I believed it. Sometimes people don't seem real to me. Anyway, I think I have ocd? I don't want to self diagnose, but some videos that I come across with have been very relatable. They answer my questions from childhood (I mean when I was really really young) cause when I was 10-11, I had this phase where I constantly pulled the door of our terrace to make sure it was closed, if I didn't I would be very uncomfortable. My family member have questioned my odd behavior but all I could say was ""my brain told me to do it"". I haven't been to school in 3 days because I keep on thinking about yesterday night when my aunt's dog sniffed me. I come off as lazy to much aunt because she saw me laying down doing nothing but doomscroll, I don't want to do that but it keeps me distracted even if it's just for a short while. I've been crying and shit, I don't know what to do. My mom said I was influenced by things I read or watch, it hurts that she constantly dismisses my feelings. 

She kept reassuring me to tell her if I have a problem, but when I do that she dismisses it and says I'm over dramatic and I probably learned it somewhere from social media.

1jev3h8,1742384848.0,"Worried about a Friend I have a Friend I'm getting more and more worried about and slowly I'm getting very tired of all the same over and over again.
They're mentally very unstable and were to year long therapy already but never had someone really click with them so they refused to be really honest with the therapist and are even scared to go.
Their Behavior is always repeating especially when meeting new People, they're super hyper at first, caring and lovebombing a lot, trying to spend as much time as possible with them, then after roughly a month it basically stops altogether. They also have a Knack for always having extremly toxic/redflag people around them who are often highly obsessed with said Friend.
They have a extremly self destructive behavior, i personally think they punish themselves for things they cant forgive themselves for happening and it is also probably related to their family upbringing which was very hostile, hence why I think they like to get around people with massive anger management issues. 
Besides that they tend to drop their Friends completely whenever someone else is more interesting and can act very mean.
I am the only really close person they have and one of two Friends who sticked around for some years, i am the person they trust the most and meaning the most, but it also is a huge responsibility, since I am also the one that can hurt them the most, i could even hurt them with just small things. 
They will never listen to anything related to them and always cut themselves off from reality whenever it happens and tend to do stupid stuff afterwards.
They always have phases where they're really let themselves down, are constantly depressed and avoiding nearly everyone(unless they hang out with the extrem toxic people), then there are phases were they're very happy, working a lot on themselves, you can talk much better with them and they care much more about their friendships, but then there are also the phases, which are mostly let out onto me, where they are extremly paranoid or getting angry and furious about even the smallest things, just to realize how wrong it was.
It repeats all the time every time and I am just really worried and don't know how to really handle it because of their zero tolerance for confrontation and their huge amount of paranoia, they even mistrust people when they're genuinely nice to them.

For example my friend once said to me they are disturbed about the fact that I still talk to them and am being nice and good to them, which really broke my heart to hear.

I was already thinking that maybe they have borderline or are bipolar, maybe even something completly different, the therapists tried to diagnose borderline already but never went through with it.

I have a lot of behaviors that run very deep into me. I overthink, I lash out a lot, and I’m extremely depressed and occasionally push it on to other people when I’m at my limit. To which I feel extremely guilty. (And I’m actively working on this the best I can.)
A few years ago for some context, I had an online friendgroup (in about 2022-2023) who I had  eventually been dropped by because of some of my behaviors. (Lashing out constantly because I was going through a nasty grief period after my mom had passed away.) and though I understand it wasn’t an excuse — I was dropped from the friend-group. Now, a few years later I recontacted with who I deemed to be the head honcho of the friendgroup to give them all an apology for my behavior towards them. Only for them to send me a document they had made two years ago when we had originally split up. It labeled each and every mistake I had ever made to them almost like diary entries. It told me how inconsiderate and terrible I was. Some of it, I could understand. 
But the one thing that has been getting under my skin is how they said that everyone had to walk on eggshells around me because I was just so sensitive to everything. I was 14-15 years old. I didn’t know exactly what I was doing and they never communicated to me any of these things that bothered them. Now, I’m sitting at 17, almost 18. Wondering if I’m a terrible person for how I acted in the past and if I should even really feel like I’ve changed if I can’t say that I wouldn’t do some of those things now.

1jesteb,1742375439.0,"Mentally ill sister is making my life miserable Hello

My sister 22F has been struggling with her mental health for the past year or so. We live with our elderly dad. She has been admitted to hospital twice/the psych ward once for suicidal idealations. She has been diagnosed with depression, anxiety, PTSD and has ADHD and autism.

We did not have the best upbringing. Our mother was a alcoholic and died when we were young due to that. 

I have tried so hard to be there for her, to support her, to make it a safe space, but I am so DRAINED and this is impacting on my life so much I want to disappear/having thoughts of my own to harm myself because she expects so much from me and it makes me feel depressed and hopeless for my own life. I feel like I will never escape the cycle. I feel like I can't move out until she is better due to the burden it will have on my father. Everytime I mention I want to move out to her she has a mental break and becomes inconsolable and then I feel guilty about moving out. I ask what's wrong and she says ""I don't know"" constantly.

I do all the home duties. I take her to appointments (she has crashed her car twice). I buy food for her. I do her washing. I take plates out of her room. I ask for help and she cries. I am not a mean natured person and would never blame her or intentionally be rude to her. I just ask her to help me with her mess. She is heavily medicated. I don't know if it's working.

I speak to my dad and he doesn't know how to deal with it either. I'm at a loss.

I don't really know why I'm posting. I'm sick of crying from the stress of this all. I feel like I have dealt with my mums passing and it is triggering to me to try and help her when it's the same source material that's traumatised her (if that makes sense). Everytime I try and talk to her about this she shuts down. I'm at a loss. I'm feeling very helpless and like my life will continue in this cycle.

Any advice on self care, would be really appreciated. I know that she neeeds to want to help herself, professionals help with stuff I can't, but I am so drained. I work full time to support her almost, and my life is on hold, and it's affecting all of my relationships. I feel anxious to see my friends because I just trauma dump this on them, I resent my dad for not doing more. Should I just leave? I don't know.

1jes0hl,1742371581.0,"am i just lazy or is this a sign of something bad? hi guys just a question here. i think my personal behavior has gotten a bit weird recently and i don’t really know what’s going on so i’d appreciate some insight as i don’t really have any other people to reach out to about this

recently ive been in a bad slump compared to my usual life. i have trouble getting out of bed, making simple meals, cleaning my room, even getting myself to the shower and brushing my teeth like im laying here right now and im not getting up to brush my teeth tonight it feels like i physically can’t idk. my room is a complete mess. i have absolutely no energy to hang out with anybody and i have cancelled plans more times than i can count. but i usually would try to go out with my friends all the time, clean my room regularly, and usually brushing teeth or showering or just getting up from bed is literally second nature to me and nothing to even think about.

i thought it was just a winter/spring seasonal sadness type of thing but it’s been more than three months. is it normal to just be sad for three months or is this smth i need to actually deal with? i cleaned my room like a week ago thinking it would help me reset but it had no effect and now my room is messier than it was even tho i can’t recall doing anything to make it disorganized. its like i never even cleaned it, like i just blipped thru a week. 

i make myself go exercise and go out on walks typically every other day even if i don’t feel like it bc i want to make myself feel better but it doesn’t really.. work. idk i just feel empty all the time. i’m drinking water, going outside, eating, working, all that. but i still have no energy to even take half a second to pick up a piece of trash outside my room. even my mom started berating me about my laziness; she did that tonight actually which is why i’m writing this bc it didn’t rly hit me that this was a noticeable issue until today. i’m a teen high school girl w a part time job and a gym membership. ik i have so much to be grateful for but even thinking about going to work or knowing i have plans for the day upsets me. whenever i get a text from my friends it annoys me deep down which makes me feel horrible. idk what to do it’s been months. i’ve been like seasonally sad before but it would always fade away after abt a week.

time just keeps passing by and it’s like every time i check the date on my phone another week has passed already. i feel like i blink and it’s already a new month and i don’t remember anything about these other months ykwim? it’s like they never happened like january was yesterday and now it’s march but nothing happened in between. i thought it was some pms bull and that’s what i told my friends but why won’t it go away

im not suicidal. i read some posts on here about how people who are depressed may want to die but i dont have that type of feeling. it’s more like i don’t really feel anything at all? i’m worried this sounds attention-seeking but thats really the only way i can describe it it’s like i’m numb to everything. but its not too extreme either like i still get happy if i get a good grade on a test but after that its just back to the usual nothing.

is this something that is a bigger issue or am i just experiencing seasonal sadness? please help me. thank you sm for reading

After I buzzed it it showed me just how bad it really was. It was still decent looking despite the balding cause no one would notice.

Now I have graduation in 2 months and I’m basically bald and I may never grow my hair back. Literally 2 days after I buzzed it my girl broke up with me cause she’s an avoidant attached individual and she couldn’t handle that I was her longest and most intimate relationship. The commitment was all too much ig. There was a rough phone call then she acted like everything was fine the next day then blindsided me over text saying she couldn’t handle it.

I eat a relatively balanced diet, I try to be active a few times a week and I aim to get steady sleep approx 7-9 hrs.

I have hobbies and friends and a loving partner.

But I just can't seem to shake the exhaustion.
It feels like it's been there for so long that I can just take time off work to rest because ""I'm exhausted "" doesn't cut it as an excuse. 
a one or two day rest doesn't help, it only fuels guilt and shame because there's nothing technically wrong with me.

I've been to doctors to see if there's anything wrong with me physically and they say that I'm fine.

I don't believe I'm depressed because I still feel emotions and can function like a person does from day to day. But it just feels like I'm carrying a ton of bricks with me.

No suicidal or self harm thoughts other than wishing that something would happen to me that would leave me in hospital for a week or a few , like a car accident and a major medical episode. 
Something to happen to me so the long rest is justified. And there's no way for me to feel shame or guilt about having rest.

I've been to therapists before but they don't seem to help, as unfortunately I am relatively self aware and can often figure out why I'm feeling things... all except for this.

I'm not sure what else to try when it feels like the load keeps getting heavier.

1jekmgi,1742344447.0,"I'm struggling with something but I don't know what Hey all, I'm not the best when it comes to mental health, I'm trying to find out what my problem is so I can get some advice to get better. 

When I was a kid, from the time when I was 6 years old till I was around 17 I was the peacemaker for my parents. My parents used to argue a lot and used to shout and scream at each other to the point where they would threaten to leave the house and never come back, sometimes getting as far as packing their bags and walking to the door before I would beg them to stay. I remember one time when I was 7 or 8 years old we were on holiday and they had an argument and my mum was going to leave, I remember holding her and my dads hand as she tried to walk away to her room to pack her bags to leave, she used to say that she'd go on the streets and that she would find a way to survive, I wept as I held both their hands, my dad sitting on the couch and my mum trying to walk away, I cried so hard begging her to stay and sit down so I could help them sort things out. In the end she did stay and I got them to apologise to each other for whatever the issue was and the next day they were fine and back to normal all lovey dovey with each other, while I stayed up the whole night listening to see if they had another argument and forcing myself awake to hear if anything else was sparking up because it had happened before where I woke up in the middle of the night to hear my parents arguing and shouting at each other.

This happened all throughout my childhood and has led to me developing several things. I am now really really good at eavesdropping, doing it unconsciously most of the time, I feel like I'm hyper aware of the conversations happening around me and I tend to get concerned and listen closer if I hear a raised voice. In public spaces like shopping centres I get overwhelmed with all the voices and get spooked when I hear a raised one, I get really tired really quickly because my brain automatically falls into ""listening mode"" when I'm not concentrating. 

Another thing I have developed is a talent for resolving other people's conflict, I'm not too proud of it If I'm being honest but my friend group also knows me as the peacemaker due to negotiating several tricky situations and tense conflicts in the spur of the moment. I also really hate getting into conflict and I hate the fact that I'm good at solving them, it often leaves me drained, tense, and anxious. 

  
My parents stopped involving me when I was 17, they've become really good at solving it on their own which I am extremely happy for them for, I love them both so much and I know that they love me too but I really wish they got to this point sooner. Their shouting and arguing with each other has shaped my personality so much into the person I am today at 20 years old, I find it really hard to stand up for myself, often getting a lump in my throat when I try to argue for myself and come to the verge of tears when I really need to, often resorting to shutting up and listening to what the other person has to say to avoid crying in front of them.

( throwaway account)
Hello all,

The following text is summarized by chatgpt. Thanks to my scrambled brain,  the initial number of words were around 4000. I summarized it to get to the point using chatgpt. I tend to deviate and add a lot of points that may not be required so I used this.

Also I have a tendency to elaborate something that can be communicated in a simple sentence,  and I apologise for this.

Thank you for your patience to read through everything. //


I was raised by my single mother after my father passed away when I was 15. She loved me unconditionally, but I struggled with consistency and discipline. Despite bursts of energy and focus, I failed at basic responsibilities—studying for exams, attending college, and taking care of my health.

 My procrastination and tendency to seek distractions led to deep guilt, self-hate, and episodes of running away from home at 11 and 18. Both times, I was overwhelmed by feelings of failure and even considered self-harm. My loved ones found me and showed me I was cared for, which kept me moving forward, though my struggles remained.

I fell in love with a woman who encouraged me but also isolated me from my friends. We married, had a son, and things quickly turned toxic. She became controlling, used our child as leverage, and even joined a cult church,  changing our son’s name without my consent.

 Eventually, she falsely accused me and my family of domestic violence and assault, leading to a seven-year legal battle that took everything from me. COVID prolonged it, but I was eventually cleared of all charges. We divorced, she cut me off from my son for four years.

Recently, she reached out with regret. I refused reconciliation but discussed our son's future. After years of being kept away, my son has now agreed to meet me in a month.

Yet, despite overcoming so much, I feel paralyzed in my professional and personal life. I work remotely and have vast experience in some areas but lack confidence in others. I have opportunities to grow, increase my income, and improve my life, yet I fail to take action.

 I lost a business deal because I couldn’t send a simple email for weeks. I have a business opportunity but haven’t even started preparing. Instead, I spend 14 hours daily mindlessly scrolling social media. I dread talking to clients, but I prolong trivial phone calls with friends to escape reality. It's like there are others working on the deliverables but I just become a bottle neck and the entire thing just stops bcoz of my inaction. It could be as simple as forwarding to the client an email with an attachment sent to me by my team members.

I binge on junk food daily while forcing myself to the gym 3–4 times a week. 

My biggest fear is that my son might inherit my struggles—the inability to take action despite knowing what needs to be done, the tendency to procrastinate, and the addiction to distractions.

What’s Next?

I know I need to take control, but I don’t know where to start.

I have opportunities to grow professionally, but I’m stuck in a cycle of inaction.

I have a second chance to be a father to my son, but I fear failing him.

I have dreams, interests, and goals, but I can’t seem to execute them.

I don’t want to be stuck in this cycle anymore. I just don’t know how to break free.

1jeif82,1742338398.0,"How do I get my doctor to listen to me ? Hello sorry if this is too long I tried to condense it. I (25F) was diagnosed at the age of 20 with anxiety and depression. This diagnosis came from my primary care physician who I have been a patient of since I was 11. Once I was diagnosed I was put on medication and was having counseling sessions weekly. I didn’t feel like any of it was really helping me so I just stopped all together about a month in. 

Fast forward to present day and I went in for an appointment with the same primary care physician to discuss mental health, while there I was talking to the nurse who was getting me all checked in and when we started talking about why I was there she had said that it sounds like I might have adhd as she does herself, then she had given me an adhd questionnaire as I was filling it out it felt like everything I was reading was describing my struggles to a t. 

Then my primary care physician comes in and she looks at my questionnaire and sets it aside, and starts talking to me about anxiety and depression. I told her how when filling out the questionnaire it felt like that sheet was written about my everyday life, she just continued to talk about my previous diagnosis. 

In the time period that I have been her patient I have experienced significant losses the first loss being at the age of 15. She is aware of these losses as my mom works for the same healthcare system as her and my whole family sees her. I feel that my diagnosis may have been based on these losses and not my actual struggles. I mean it would make sense that the girl who’s had so much loss so young would be depressed but I feel like there’s maybe more to it. 

How do I get her to listen to me and help maybe diagnose me if that’s what’s needed ? I don’t really want to have to change providers as I have been her patient for so long and have always been happy with her care til now, and with my mom working for the same healthcare system and my whole family going to her I feel it would be messy trying to go to a different provider.

At the time i could blame it on my home life but since then everything has resolved itself, and while I no longer suffer from the previous two symptoms,I feel like I'm getting worse. I've been to the doctor a few times, as I'm extremely lucky to have a mother that cares so much about me but I feel I'm starting to be the girl who cried wolf. I've been told three times ""Oh, I've never heard of that before"". First I explained my ""Cameras"" that watched me constantly. Making sure im normal enough because if not they'll gossip about me. Second was my reaction to an anxiety medication, Zoloft, one night it caused me to become unresponsive and my mom was wiping the drool from my face and I couldn't even drop my body onto the couch. I've since changed medication and it's been working but hearing my doctor tell me she's never heard of anyone reacting like that was like a stab in the heart. The third, and the worst, is currently ongoing and I feel like I'm going crazy because my doctor said she didn't know what was wrong with me. I have these episodes where parts of my body refuse to move. It happens at school and at home, but rarely when out with friends. Often I'll have to use my hand or mouth to shake the body part into moving but in cases where it's my entire body im just out of luck. One day before school I was panicking sitting on the floor unable to move anything but my neck. After about half an hour my mom got home, and to assist me onto my bed. I really don't think it has anything to do with my body itself, as with enough time it can resolve itself.

And I end up believing that I have this certain thing, and i spend so much of my time researching and understanding it.

1jee5vf,1742327642.0,"Imposter syndrome and constant rejection in my grad program are making me really depressed Hi everyone. I’m a first year in my graduate degree program. I was warned of imposter syndrome by my advisor in undergrad, but I honestly wasn’t expecting it to be as bad as it has been.

I went from a really small undergraduate university to a very large graduate university. My application year was apparently quite competitive from what I’ve heard, and everyone in my class is extremely smart. I was expecting to not be the smartest in the class, but it feels like everyone outpaces me by MILES. 

Basically it just feels like everyone is smarter than me and more hardworking. I never had good study skills and I still don’t and I guess it’s showing now. I’ve always been really bad at putting my thoughts into words out loud as well, so I hardly ever participate in class. The other girls try to encourage me to go out of my comfort zone but I just freeze up, meanwhile they are confident and so well articulated. Sometimes they will share an answer to a question, or a thought they were having, or a question they have and I’m honestly just always in awe that they even thought of that.

So on top of those feelings I’ve already been having, I feel like they are being affirmed because I keep getting rejected from things I apply for. I applied to be a TA or reader/grader for the spring semester and got rejected from that, while one of my cohort members was accepted. I applied for a summer research program and got rejected from that while once again, another girl was accepted. I applied for a program scholarship that gives 2 per cohort and wasn’t selected. I applied for a program that would start in the summer and go through next school year that takes 2 students per cohort as well, and just got rejected from that now. Apparently there is an interview phase before they make selections and I didn’t even make the interview.

I am trying to stay positive and to continue applying for things that interest me, but knowing who my competition is it just feels so pointless. Time and time again I’m being reminded that compared to these other people, I suck. And I feel stupid because I know rejection is a part of life, but it’s just been over and over these last few months… I also hate to be this person, but at my smaller university, I got into everything I applied for and was always a top candidate, so this is just so disheartening and honestly confusing for me. Being “smart” was one of the only things that I felt like I had going for me. So if I don’t even have that anymore… what do I have? I don’t know if I’ve ever felt anything worse than repeatedly giving my all and it still not being enough over and over again. I don’t know how much more of it I can take.

I am so exhausted. I’m burnt out and feel like a failure. I want to give up so bad. I never tell people when I apply for things now so I don’t have to tell them I failed again. And I want to be happy for the girls in my cohort, especially because I do consider most of them my friends, but I know in my heart I have some resentment, and that it will probably get worse the more this keeps happening. And as the title says, it’s making me extremely depressed. Whenever I have a second of free time, I sleep. I am always tired. I neglect eating and hygiene to sleep. I neglect my studies to sleep.

1je5295,1742304838.0,"Just had a talk with my first ex. **Context**  
I (19m) just went through a breakup with my (19f) girlfriend. We broke up a month ago. Until two months before the breakup, the relationship was very strong. But then I noticed she kept putting less and less effort into the relationship, and she noticed it too. Her mental state was declining and she was completely emotionally shutting down because every time she thought about the way she felt about me she felt about her mental state and how it's affecting things, so her feelings in general declined. She felt awful about the way she treated me, especially because she felt I treated her so well. So she broke up with me to stop hurting our relationship more and more. That way she could figure out her mental state and reevaluate her feelings in general, which naturally have to include hers for me.

**The talk**  
Yesterday we sat down and talked about it all for about an hour. It went well. As well as it could've. She's still figuring out her own feelings and is still overwhelmed with her mental state, but she's working on it. We've decided we at least want to be friends and can at least handle that.

She made it very clear that we did not break up because of anything I did, or any way the relationship was structured. She broke up because she has a problem with shutting down when her mental state got bad, so she wasn't able to support the relationship and wants to get better for herself so she doesn't keep hurting me. I made it clear to her that my feelings are unchanged, if anything I just understand more that I love her. We left things on very good terms, and I want to be with her again when her mind is in a better state. Obviously we have no idea how possible that is, but we can at least try.

She's glad that I didn't have to leave her life completely. I made sure she doesn't blame me, and she knows I don't blame her but she understands she's at fault and this is all unfair to me, that the situation is unfair and is hurting me a lot. She knows I'm still in love with her and is accepting that, and is okay talking about any feelings. She doesn't know how she feels right now but she at least would like to be with me again when she's better and if we can still work. There's no guarantee of anything, but for now we're friends.

I fight with workman’s comp but they determined it was not covered. Finally now 6 months later I am finally having surgery BUT financially we are in the brink of loosing it all! I need to have this surgery so I can heal properly and then I can get back to work, but I am struggling with that since I feel I need to go find a job (anything at this point) and have the surgery next year when we have an opportunity to get in a better place financially. I told my husband last night that I am tired and that life shouldn’t be this damn hard just to make it! I told him the only thing that stops me from ending it myself is the 3 of them and how much they would hurt! I told him I hope that I don’t wake up from surgery! The look in his eyes shattered my heart! I love this man! I do not ever want to hurt him! I just don’t want to have to struggle financially until I die!

1jeb9qh,1742320656.0,"ED - struggling to gain weight Hello reddit, 

TW: Talks of Eating disorder and weightloss (trying to gain weight) 
(Mentions of #Lbs lost, AuDHD)

Looking for advice I think? This might be a bit ranty, I'm sorry, I'm just so burnt out, I don't know who to ask...

I *had* been in very good recovery from my ED up until end of last year when I got food poisoning and lost 8lbs in one day, since then I have been losing weight and struggling to gain anything back. 

I know my eating habits are not great, I struggle to remember to eat or with knowing I'm hungry or not, often til I feel lightheaded or sick. (Yay audhd)

I've been trying so hard for months to regain weight but it feels like everytime I feel good and like I'm eating more so I should gain weight and then to see the scale go down even more? I'm so discouraged... 

I'm terrified for my health, I haven't had my period for 3 months and counting now... (no I'm not pregnant, I haven't been secually active since early November when my weightloss started to affect my sex drive.) 

It's affecting all aspects of my life now, I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know how to get out, what to eat or how to make sure I can eat enough and still afford it.. the cost of groceries is so bad here everything's so expensive. 

I've tried implementing yogurt or chia seeds into my diet but I struggle with the texture and the sweetness. (Yay Audhd)
I've been really avoiding overly sweet tasting things lately, my sweet tooth ran away... to the point even some yogurt is too sweet?? 

I live in a studio, which makes meal prep and cooking in general really difficult with limited space and my tendency to become easily overwhelmed.

Im moving in April to a larger place with roommates so hopefully I'll be able to meal prep comfortably then? 

But in the meantime I am struggling, and feel like I really hit a wall of feeling defeated today... 

I just don't understand why I can't keep any weight on...

Any tips or advice would be appreciated...

I just need some easy things i can keep in my bag or can quickly grab on the go to help me gain weight... 

Thank you for your time...
I'm sorry if this is long and ranty or all over...

1jeb9n9,1742320649.0,"Feeling the darkness winning I’ve had severe depression/anxiety pretty much my whole life. I had a failed attempt when I was younger, and towards the end of 2023, in the height of my PPD/caretaker burnout/feeling like a nanny more than a wife, I made a decision that I was done. I wrote out letters to the people I love and care about apologizing.

I didn’t go through with it. I found something that made me happy, but I did partake in self-harm. It wasn’t as bad as it could’ve been, but I knew if I didn’t get help I would end up going too far.

I got help, got on meds that seemed to help and overall felt better.

Lately, I’m feeling the dread return. The waves of depression are overwhelming. Once it passes, it’s manageable, but during I just want it to end. I’m not sleeping right, I can’t get myself to eat properly without getting sick, and I feel like a shell. I tried talking to my doctor about it, and they just gave me Ativan. That does nothing at all, and I don’t know how to get out of this.

1jeb2na,1742320181.0,"Help with a bipolar diagnosis Im an 18year old female, from the UK and i recently went to the GP (about 4 months ago) about my on/off depression of probably about 4/5 years that has been getting worse throughout 2024. Anyway they prescribed me SSRI’s which I took for 3 months, and it quickly turned from being suicidal to going insane. 

I was out almost every-night alone, I did any drugs around slept with random people burnt through a shit tonne of money and destroyed my friendship of about 7 years. I spoke to everyone and was extremely social for a normally very introverted austistic individual. Then after seeing dark figures in my room and hearing people calling me name convinced they were ghosts i realised I probably needed help ( I wasn’t doing any drugs at this point either). 

I spoke to my mum and she told me that my dad’s uncle was institutionalised and offed himself and my dad also offed himself when I was 10, and he was a little loopy too. So I made an appointment with the GP and attempted in the time after I came off the antidepressants and before I got the appointment (evidently unsuccessful). I got reffed to the CMHT and have an appointment with them tomorrow im assuming I got this because I’m high risk. 

Im not sure what to do honestly because I have a hard time explaining my symptoms and stuff, should I say straight to the person I talk to that i think I have bipolar so I can get a phyc diagnosis or will that make them tell me to stop being dramatic. 

Apart from the recent “manic” episode i realised I’ve been cycling in and out of depression since I was first diagnosed at 14, and when I’m not depressed im either quite functional or It’s as if I’ve consumed 1000mg of caffeine and become a super health queen and go to the gym for 3 hours and do every piece of schoolwork ever. Basically I become an insane machine, which im assuming would be mania idk. 

Im prepared for the long wait for my diagnosis because I just don’t think my depression is depression like I just know when something is wrong (cringe I know but help pls). But also im so fucking scared because I may have to accept I might be loopy batshit (not to be offensive to others with bipolar im sure your all cool asf)

Context: I (currently as of writing) am doing a film project with my friends and classmates for a school competition, the winner gets 100 in grades. I'm also a working student (so i have a messy schedule) meaning i was somewhat late on most days. I am also in a gc with the director, the main actors and the co director.

My friend (who is the main actor) kept telling me that somehow my filming isn't great. She said to ""keep fixing my camera, dont make the camera shake"". I tried to improve it over time, even asking for the director to check up on me. I was scolded for sometimes forgetting the memory card to save the videos but it was fine overall.

Until today, my friend told me when we were gonna film that i cant really do anything right and to stop shaking or just do better angles. That made me depressed in a way that hurt me, they're a good friend, but when they told me that i felt hurt and sad. It just stuck with me for the whole day.

1je8lpj,1742314159.0,"Worsening day by day Hey guys I just need to come on here to vent. To start off with some background Im a 17 year old female and Ive been struggling with mental health for most of my life due to traumatic experiences from when I was really young and not even old enough to understand these experiences (Sa, emotional neglect, emotional abuse, financial hardships, witnessing violent events between adults, more). These experiences changed the way I percieve the world and Im in an all time dissociative state. Ive felt like I never really truly deeply cared about anyone or anything because I have a huge block on my emotions and I can't process anything that I feel. Ive tried therapy over the course of the past 10 years, I have tried medications, different coping mechanisms such as going to the gym, journaling, speaking with others, etc and it feels like nothing ever helps. Truth be told over the past years more situations occured and I ended up in the mental hospital during march of 2024. Some events before the hospitalization were, multiple instances of non consensual sexual encounters with men(kissing, touching, I felt disgusted), I was rped, rumors circulating at school of me, physical altercations with my parents, in the midst of an existenstial crisis, and I was deep into a psychotic depression. This past year I had gotten better but I was still severely depressed and still struggling with Sh, but recently as I mentioned before Ive been having flashbacks to everything since its march again. These episodes are long and cause me to have erratic emotions and behaivors which I tend to cry for extended periods of time following up with waves of violent and frequent anger in shame, guilt, and dread of the past. My relationship with my parents had bettered but during my last episode I lashed out on my parents and they had told me I could control my flashbacks (they are strict religious asian/hispanic immigrants) and I need to better myself or they would send me back to the hospital(which also traumatized me severely, its also a part of my episodes). Now Im falling back to despair and Im trying to hold on but I want to give up. I know Im going to have to suffer with this my whole life and its miserable, I feel miserable. Every event in my life feels meaningless if in the end all we do is work and then die. I want to keep fighting but the fact I have to keep fighting for my whole life is so discouraging.

I am writing this as I haven’t been in contact with my mother and my abusive step father for 7 years but I still can t get over it…


My mother cheated on my dad with a man that was a jobless alcoholic guy and they became a couple after her divorce. 

Then I was forced to live with that person and as soon as he entered our lives he was really violent,

At this time they been together for 4 months but he showed really bad behavior already, I have a memory of him pushing me in the stairs while holding me by the hood, making me hang by the neck when I was 13. 
At this time my mother didn’t really reacted and promised me it was about to change but it went worse and worse. 

They was re-building houses so whenever I wasn’t at school I had to work all day long for free, while being insulted, beat up, humiliated etc etc this has lasted for 5 years 

Have memories of that person beating me on the ground because I forgot 1 thing on his groceries list and can remember that he was holding his blows. 

That person was manipulating my mother saying that my behavior toward him was making him felt unloved and then my mother forced me to say to him daily “I love you” 
That is still a trauma to this day

Someday I was able to escape the house and since then I never looked back 
But since then all those scenes never came out of my mind, I still think about it almost everyday and I have a shit ton of anger into me. 

For sure that experience made the person that I am today and I know inside of me I got a lot of bad reflexes from this time like not being able to hold eye-to eye contact with anybody,
Not being able to raise up when being abused at work, being depending to love, etc, etc….

I tried everything, psychology, I do a lot of sports, arts, hobbies, even tried acid but never changed nothing inside of me 

I know deeply that I won’t ever be able to forget my past but how do you learn to live with ? 
That is really hard and to this day I sometimes  still feel suicidal or really mad at the world…

1je5v6t,1742307064.0,"Soo…. Is it normal to have multiple intense breakdowns within a week as a teenager..? If u see this a response would be greatly appreciated 
Uhhh so I’m 15 and for the last 3 years I’ve kinda been suspecting I have BPD, I’m not here to ask anyone to diagnose me or self diagnose myself but I practically have most of the symptoms…? They’ve gotten better recently kind of but It’s still hard for me to function sometimes

Anyways I’ve opened up to my parents and counselor about my worries and basically their answer was “I don’t believe you I think it’s puberty because you don’t act the way someone with bpd would” and like last time I talked about this the only answer I got was “get a new counselor” which I can’t really do since my counselor is school appointed… Maybe I really am just delusional or maybe they just can’t see the sides of me that make me suspect I have bpd..? I’m pretty good at being happy go lucky and acting thoughtless which might he part of it and honestly it takes a lot of courage for me to talk about these things in person and the few times I have I have always been met with “I don’t believe you” which has just caused me to become even more uncomfortable with talking about these things and ending up talking about surface level things during counseling. The only time I ever got any semblance of help was when I was incredibly suicidal and was planning my death and had at some point admitted that to my homeroom teacher in TEARS!! And that got to my parents of course which was when I started counseling and was given medication (Without a proper diagnosis…!!) Throughout the last 3 years I’ve had extremely debilitating anxiety and breakdowns over relations between my friends and I, I’ve been self harming for the last year, and I very often have suicidal thoughts 

I have breakdowns maybe… every two weeks on the super lesser end and every 2 days on the other end though normally it’s once or twice a week and it’s…!!! Very difficult most of the time!! Was very close to attempting 6 days ago though I stopped myself.

I think these have been the hardest couple months of my life. My relationship with a close sister kinda spurred my spiral. I started getting suicidal, and not like the passive suicidal that I deal with on a day to day basis. I’ve been in a partial hospitalization program, and I think over all it’s helped. It’s helped me talk about getting assaulted as a child, it’s helped me talk about my rape and countless adult men who knew I was a child and got excited about it. I think opening up about it all makes me feel like I’m walking around with open wounds. And I was tired of trying. I started letting go of the steering wheel when I drove. After about a week I told someone and they basically said check yourself into a hospital or I’m calling the police, did that, got through. But I immediately got like worse and I couldn’t ground and I started doing prescribed benzos. I got readmitted to a hospital, and it was a really intense place. Like needing to ask to go to the bathroom, every door is locked. Great for safety, not great for sanity. I was there for about a week before I discharged. The next day after that, I drank with my meds, I didn’t think that just one glass would effect me as much as it did, I made a whole plan, took all my prescriptions, talked to my best friend and said that I loved him, and I would never be enough for him. I survived. I just got out of the hospital again. I am taking a break from the friendship, I can never come back from it. I ruined what we had.

1jdszfi,1742259356.0,"I’m going to the hospital next week. It’s gotten so bad. I so envy people with functional depression, even though I would have hated anyone who said that while I was functioning while horribly depressed. I quit my job. I dropped out of school after struggling through a 4 year degree for 9 years. My therapist dumped me in January because I wasn’t improving. I have averaged MAYBE 100 steps for months. I never had a plan, but at some point I started slowly making myself dead. 

I stay in bed all day, almost every day. I have bed sores and other gross stuff because of it. If I’m not 300 pounds yet, I’m definitely getting there just by liver volume alone. I’ve destroyed my body with addiction and not moving and not being able to eat anything besides Mac and cheese and Monster Energy. The only people I talk to are my mom and my abusive ex, who I still see because I’m lonely and he’s the only person who has seen how I live and is allowed in my home - which is disgusting. My landlords will probably sue when I move out. I cannot do anything and I don’t know why. I may as well be on life support. I want to do so much and I just…don’t. I think I used to be different. 

I am 32 years old. I remember things being bad, but better. I just don’t remember how long ago that was. Maybe 2 years? So many traumatizing things happened as I entered my 30s and I just devolved, first into functional self-destruction and then into pure actual rot. 

I’m so lucky. My life should be amazing, especially because I got a huge head start in life.

I’m checking myself into a long-term residential program 3 hours away. The wheels have been in motion ever since my therapist quit, but last week I finally made the final call that would get me a move-in date. These savings were supposed to be my 10-year safety net as a disabled, uneducated, unqualified-for-anything adult; I’m willing to take a chance and give it all up for even the tiniest hope that this place can help me become something other than that. 

Minimum stay is 6 weeks. Median stay is a year.  My ex can have the apartment. I’m running the fuck away. I have nothing to lose. 

I’m lucky to have this option. I’m so grateful for it. I want to be able to enjoy the life I could have that other people probably wouldn’t have wasted the way I did. 

I don’t even know how I’ll be ready to go in a week. So much needs to be done, and I don’t do *anything*. I’m so scared when I get there they’ll tell me I’m too sick for their type of program.

I didn’t realise depression could come on so gradually. I think it started after I left college. I left during the ADHD med shortage because I couldn’t handle it anymore without the same medication that got me three A’s and a B in my first year. I was even sent a  message asking to go to a meeting about applying to Oxford or Cambridge Uni. It felt like a dream come true. 

I was devastated that I had to leave, and ever since then, it’s like my personality has just slipped away from me slowly, I find myself looking at old videos of me from those happy times going “wow, I was so funny” “wow, I wish I was still like that now” etc. I never realised this was depression until tonight. 

I always put it down to my ADHD meds not working, but I don’t even think my ADHD medication was the problem. I got them back 4 months after I left college and I remember being confused that they didn’t work the same way. As if they just suddenly stopped working.

So I got a dosage increase, being absolutely convinced that this was the issue. And sure it got a little better, but *something* was missing. I’d find myself saying “why don’t they work as well as they did two years ago?!” 

That *something*, that I was missing, was actually caused by depression. I was missing my enjoyment out of life, my sense of purpose, my interest in my hobbies, my motivation. 

I take my first pill of sertraline tomorrow, and I’m hoping this will be where life finally starts to look a little brighter for me.

1jdyj4a,1742278397.0,"Why does choosing not getting better make people think you’re a villain? Hi all. Here’s a question: why is choosing not to get better make you a bad person?

For context, I have been dealing with mental health for years. I am now 18.

12: Realized I was Transgender FtM.

13-14: Came out to family and parents (they were not accepting which hurt me), COVID later started which led me to my first suicide attempt (I told my school guidance counselor about the attempt and got sent to a mental hospital), got diagnosed with depression and SI. Was on medication for a short while.

15-16: In and out of mental hospitals throughout the school year which caused me to have low grades and having to makeup a lot of work/go to summer school. Started a therapy program which I graduated from and met my now ex. Started dating hours after we met that day.

16-17: Relationship was toxic and I constantly felt left/abandoned when he went to go do simple things. Which led to arguments and breaking up over and over.

18: Started college, went to classes for about 2 weeks then rotted in bed for the whole fall semester. Constantly tried to OD. Went to multiple mental hospitals out of those 4 months in college and got kicked out the dorms for safety reasons. Then got diagnosed with BPD, MDD and Bipolar 1. Huge manic episode happened when o ran away from my home, took my own $200, blocked my parents, impulsively spent that money, crashed with a dealer friend and moved to his friends house, tried to OD there as well when I started to get depressed, got back on meds, got kicked out after a month because I couldn’t pay rent, went back home and doing the same therapy program I once graduated from.

It’s as if getting better is too much work. A part of me is fine with who I am and doesn’t want to change. Perhaps I’m comfortable being mentally ill but I’m sort of sick of others saying people that don’t want to better themselves are horrible human beings. We’re suffering just like any other mentally ill person—but that doesn’t matter apparently. I am not a terrible person, I am a hurt person that’s just given up. I haven’t killed anybody, I haven’t SA’d anybody, I haven’t committed some huge crime against society therefore I am not horrible. I am just done.

Recently, my boyfriend opened up to me about how he's not been doing well and I want nothing more than to help him :(! He's been saying things like stuff he enjoyed isn't fun anymore like video games or hanging out with friends/family, he never smiles or laughs anymore (not just with me, but when I see him with his friends hes always straight faced instead of his usual loudness), his grades have been slipping and he's falling behind on his Eagle Project. I'm thinking that he's been depressed because he has mentioned before that he's sad to graduate and leave all his friends, but I'm not sure.

It’s like I feel like I need to be up and doing something (kind of like an uneasy feeling if I’m not) and I can’t just lay down and watch something. It’s almost a restlessness but I have no motivation to actually get up and do things. My brain is telling me I need to move and work on something but I just feel like I can’t. It’s a hard feeling to describe. I’ve seen some people say it is related to being anxious but it’s constant.

1jdnqt8,1742245381.0,"My life has been completed ruined by men and I don’t know how to get out of it since I am trapped. 
Every traumatic experience in my life has been caused by men. My childhood bully was a man. I was sexually assaulted and harassed by men before barely hitting puberty or having my first kiss. I’ve been in multiple abusive relationships one of which led to my suicide attempt. I got into my dream college and then a man spread rumors about me and I had to drop out due to bullying and worsening mental health. And last but not least. My dad. The only man who has caused me more trauma than any of them who I can’t run away from.
I have severe mental health issues and every professional I’ve seen has confirmed that they were caused by childhood trauma, a lot relating to my father. I’m still in therapy but over the years my mental health has just gotten worse and worse causing me to get to a point where I can’t even take care of my self, stay in school, or keep a job. My psychiatrist literally cried because she was so sad about how bad I was getting and the affect my dad has on me. The issue is, I’m 100% financially dependent on my father, and he’s in complete control of my life, which is exactly what he wants. He works in finance yet never taught me how to manage my own finances and I have no idea how to. He knows this. I don’t even know how to access my bank accounts. If I cut my father off I would be homeless and probably end up dead fast. I wouldn’t have money for food, healthcare (including mental health), housing, etc. Yet my mental health has gotten so bad that I can’t keep a job or stay in school long enough to finish a degree. It’s a vicious cycle. If I want to have the finances to get mental health care, I have to rely on my dad, yet having him in my life worsens my mental health. Leaving me depressed and forever reliant on him. I used to work and save money but I have no idea how much i have because my dad controls my accounts and won’t tell me how much I have saved.

1jdv26f,1742265585.0,"My effort to change feel useless and i feel so hopeless and unseen Im 23 male. i was a really smart kid all my life up until high school (age 17) in malaysia there’s a huge exam that decides which university you’ll be able to go to. i scored really well and got straight A’s. i have never not gotten straight A’s in any important exam. i was also active in co curriculum in high shcool and so with good results and my achievements in co curriculum activities in high school, i was able to secure a scholarship to study in the UK. 

When i got to the UK, i changed. I wasnt a good student who studies well, scores well and my attendance was really bad. This kept going for 3 years (2024 summer). After failing to maintain a good result, i had to go back to Malaysia as my sponsor asked me to. Ever since that my relationship with my father has become so much worse. 

While i was in the UK, i found a girlfriend (malaysian, not english) who i love very much. As i was doing worse and worse with my studies, it affected my relationship as i was under so much stress. When i had to come back to Malaysia because my sponsor asked me to, she started to become the least of my priorities. I was extremely occupied with dealing with my Sponsor and parents and i was very emotionally and physically exhausted but more so emotionally. I felt like ive extremely disappointed my parents and i felt worthless as a son. I wasnt available for my partner and i ended up ghosting her as i couldnt at all bring myself to be there for her. I was always exhausted from dealing with my sponsor and my parents. The whole time i ghosted her, the only thing that kept me going was the fact that i wanted to get things in my life back together before i go back to her because i became a very angry person whenever i was with her while this all was going on and i dont want that for her. she doesnt deserve to deal with an angry man. I am aware that my mistake of not communicating this to her was a big one but i couldnt bring myself to reach out to her as things were still messy and hectic on my end. in my head that seems like itll just slow down my progress which will delay me getting back on my feet and being able to be with her again.

3 months later, things are looking much better as i was getting full attendance for all my subjects in university, my results are improving so much more and i am scoring really well in my exams. I also got approved by my sponsor to continue my studies in Malaysia and things were looking to go well and I have finally managed to get my life back together. I decided to reach out to her because ive changed from being a loser and have changed things in my life for the better. But shes already moved on, and shes already starting to see someone else. I have never felt so hopeless in my life. I feel like the effort and work i put in the past 3/4 months have been completely useless. 

My relationship with my dad is also not getting any better as he doesnt feel like ive changed. this makes me feel even more unseen and im really at the point of quitting and feeling like theres no point in trying anymore. it just feels like nothing is worth the effort as the effort ends up being unseen and worthless.

I don't know how to tell her that I haven't been able to imagine myself doing anything long term because I didn't think I'd be alive this long. I've been suicidal since I was 11. I've thought every single year (up until this one) would be the one where my attempt would finally work. 

I'm not suicidal anymore, but I still don't know how to imagine myself doing anything. 

On top of all of this, I don't know who I am. Not in the normal ""oh I'm figuring myself out"" way, but in a ""I can't remember any of my life and as a result, don't know what I like"". I still struggle with looking in the mirror and actually feeling like I'm seeing myself, I just feel so detached.

My friend is my age and my Dad introduced us and we became really good friends. Well, this friend is suicidal and often, before I met him (I was living abroad) my Dad had to go to his house and find him after he overdosed with different medecines he's been prescribed. He is very erratic with his medicine: sometimes he doesn't take it and sometimes he takes all of it in one go. Well, he is currently visiting his boyfriend in Norway, and wrote to my Dad yesterday asking for money. Well, I wasn't completely aware of his financial situation but apparently he owes my Dad, his boyfriend and the bank a shitton of money. He told my Dad he was gonna khs if he didn't get the money. He was asking for 600€. My Dad refused to give him all that money and instead decided to give him installments of 15€ a day, so that he wouldn't spend it all in one day. My friend completely disregarded this text, saying that he needed the 600€ immediately and that he wanted to die. My Dad wrote back, ""do not emotionally blackmail me"". After a couple of hours my friend wrote to my Dad that him calling him out on his behaviour was completely unfair, given the fragile state he was in.

1jdmngd,1742242722.0,"Im not doing so good I've been finding it so hard to do things due to a lack of energy and motivation. I've not been enjoying the things i used to love, this has been happening for a few years now and keeps getting worse. I try to do the things i used to like such as colouring, arts and crafts, drawing etc but i really dont enoy it and get bored very easily, even watchjng movies/shows the same thing happens i become so disinteressted. Ecerything feels so forceful to do. I find it hard to do basic things like showering, cleaning, tidying etc. I feel quite hopeless and worthless, and my suicidal thoughts are occurring more and just become more enticing, like a moth being drawn to a light. I feel quite low/numb most days. I also have bad anxiety andagoraphobia which makes it so hard to just go outside i want to cry and panic at just the thought if going out i struggle interacting with others and struggle to speak/converse (although this has happened majority of my life) i hate that i always feel like im being percieved/watched. I struggle to even do things like walking or excersing in my own bedroom becuse if the lack of motivation. It feels like i have this invicabble force that just makes it hard to get started. Like a constant push and pull/tug of war. All this has bee happening for many years and its been getting worse. I rember telling my mum about thinking i may have depression when i was around 13 (im 21 now) and she just seemed to brush it off and forgot aabout the converstaion the very next day. A
similar thing happened when i mentioned having quite alot if anxiety around the same time aswell. She said dont be so silly and seemed to forget about it the next day too. I remember when i was around 15 my secondary school told my mum about my self harm, this was with my permission, she forgot about the converstation the very next day. I haven't and still dont tell her whats going on because it seems pointless and like she wont care. When my mum found out my sister self harmed, it was a much bigger deal and my sister got help for that at this time she was around 14 and i think i was 17. I felt quite angry and annonyed that my mum listened to her but she just dissmissed and forgot about everyhing i had told her so i felt like and still feel like i dont matter. I have no one to talk to aabout this as im quite scared and feel ashamed. I also blame myself for not speaking up and telking others how i truley fell but its so scary and im worried others wont care or will just dismiss and forget what i say. I feel so lost and im not sure what to do. Also ive been put on 50mg of sertraline for my anxiety/agoraphobia for around one and a half months now but i dont feel like its helping and feel like its making my brain a little foggy which makes it hard for me to remember some things, becoming more forgetful.

doqwow,1572360722.0,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",2361,177,2,"mostbroken leastunderstood rules helpers may invite private contact first resort , made new wiki explain understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help , type response usually leads either disappointment disaster . usually works quite differently say pm anytime casual social context . huge admiration appreciation goodwill good citizenship many support others flag inappropriate content even know many struggling . hard work behind scenes information resources make easier give get quality help small start . new wiki page explains detail much better respond public comments , least gotten know someone . maintained rdepressionwikiprivate_contact , full text current version . summary anyone , acting helper , invites accepts private contact i.e . pms , chat , kind offsite communication early conversion showing either bad intentions bad judgement . either way , unwise trust . pm anytime seems like kind generous offer . might perfectly wellmeaning , , unless solid rapport established , wise idea . points consider offer accept invitation communicate privately . posting supportive replies publicly , help people op . responses good quality , educate inspire helpers . 1990 rule applies much anywhere else internet . people struggling serious mentalhealth issues often justifiably low tolerance disappointment highlevel everchanging emotional need . unless helper able make 100 commitment every way , long necessary , offering personal inbox resource likely harm good . mentalhealth crisisline responders usually give names callers allowed request specific responders . much healthier safer callers develop relationship agency whole . analogously , much safer healthier ops develop relationship community whole . even trained responders generally allowed work highintensity situations alone . partly availability , mostly wider perspective preventing compassion fatigue . helper gets head someone whose mentalhealth issues including suicidality , often comorbid depression escalate , pm conversation much harder others , including rdepression rsuicidewatch moderators help . contrary common assumptions , moderators see police pms . observation many years , people say pm consistently ones least understanding mentalhealth issues mentalhealth support . gaps knowledge ability communicate effectively . community input mitigates limitations . reason someone truly help would want hide responses community scrutiny . helpers concerned privacy , keep mind selfdisclosure , used supportively , feelings details , problem use altthrowaway accounts , restrictions account age karma . know internet used people exploit abuse others . people want hide deceptive manipulative responses everyone except victims . many specifically target vulnerable mentalhealth issues . helper invites op talk privately gives good , supportive experience , primed person vulnerable abusers . sort cognitive priming tends particularly effective someone state mentalhealth crisis , people rely heuristics critical reasoning . ops want talk privately , posting wideopen anonymous forum like reddit might best option . although recommend , allow ops request private contact asking support . want , please keep expectations realistic , careful look history anyone offers pm opening ."

1jgam82,1742539067.0,"I hate myself and I hate everything Hello
I don’t know what’s the point of writing this and whether anyone is going to read it.
But I need to say it
I hate myself 
From a young age I knew I wasn’t attractive 
and people made sure I knew
I remember my father trying to cover my big forehead with my hair when I was 7
I remember him telling me to get inside and to stop playing with the girls because “you’re too old” when I was the youngest of the group.
I remember friends making fun of my looks in high school, “I’ve never seen a nose bigger than yours”
“Baldie” , “you have no eyelashes”

I remember my sister telling me I look like in my thirties when I was only 18
I remember when we were swimming and as my sister was taking pictures of us I asked her to only take a picture of me if I look good, she looked through the camera and said no you don’t look good. Her face looked very sorry 

I met someone a few months back, she mistook for my older sister who’s 15 years older than me.
And she actually said you look more like your older sisters 

I got married a few years ago and a few months after we got married my husband told me he didn’t find me attractive first but got used to it 
I cried so much after that and I kept crying every time I remember that
We don’t even have sex that often , even in our honeymoon and I know that that is because I’m ugly
I hate hime for that
I wish we didn’t get married 
But we have a baby now

My baby is really cute and im glad she is
I don’t want her to feel the way I felt my whole life
Some people commented on how cute she is and I asked does she look like me, all of them said Noo! 
It hurrtssss

I hate myself
I hate everything about me
Inside and outside 
I hate the way I think
How depressed i am

I don’t want my baby to grow up with a mother like me
I don’t know how to make it right 

I tried therapy for years. it didn’t work for me
I tried burying myself in work
I tried being positive and doing hobbies 
I tried everything 
Every thing

I don’t know what to do

I’m getting uglier by the year
I lost half of my already thin hair after having the baby
You could see my scalp from a million miles away

I gained 30 kgs

My body is covered in body acne and stretch marks
We barely have sex anymore 

Part of the reason is that i hate myself and don’t want my husband to look at my body 
And he doesn’t even initiate any form of intimacy that leads to that

I stopped taking care of myself because I have done that, and look where it led me.

Every night I go to sleep I pray I never wake up
Not because I’m ugly on the outside , but because it’s even worse in my head.

It’s like an addiction, you often wonder… would anyone do this for me? People ask you at work, or a casual conversation “How are you?” And all you can do is lie and say “I’m good how about you” with a fake smile on your face because you feel like nobody genuinely cares at the end of the day. It also gets to the point where you don’t want to burden or bother anyone with your problems so what’s the point of even speaking? It bottles up in your brain to the point where you think to yourself how it would feel to not be alive and experience this torture any longer. I don’t know how people make it so long, it’s often the ones you’d never expect and some of that stems from being functionally depressed.

1jgkay0,1742572957.0,"Weird theory abt my depression This one is for all the women with depression.

So for me, normally in a healthy menstrual cycle, my boob shape/size fluctuates a little over the period, not too noticeable to others but clear to me. I know my period is coming soon because my boobs get bigger, which is normal for most people. Another PMS (PREmenstrual syndrome for the men that think pms is smtg women have during their period) symptom I have is straight up awful depressive thinking. I don't get annoyed but rather self hating and negatively thinking about anything that relates to myself.

I have had enough depressive episodes to realise, when I am going through one, my boob size is the SAME as my PMS shape. I don't gain weight during my depressive episodes, I am quite steady. These episodes are awful because I cannot dictate how long they will be, so its not like I get relieved when my period comes, it's just indefinite. I do suffer with occasional low mood in between episodes to, but I would only say I am truly depressed in my episodes. 

This makes me think I must have a hormonal imbalance, which links to increase in estrogen which causes my boobs to grow. I don't know where to go from here, I tried to google about women who might have bigger boobs on their period but most the information is about obesity and it's affect on depression or societal standards on boob sizes.

Yh it's a weird thought process but was wondering if anyone had the same experience as me/ have more information.

1jgbf2d,1742542703.0,"I don't wanna go to class First of all, my english is terribly bad, so i may have some errors explaining this.

I have depression, anxiety and cptsd due sexual abuse. I've been in a psychiatric center two times, first for almost two months, and the second for three months. I left the second in 31st Jan, so is recently. I'm medicated with antidepressants and antipshychotics.

Since I left the psychiatric, I was in class like 3 or 4 days since I left, so I haven't go for two months.
I live with my mom, an she's extremely angry with me. I don't have a good relationship with her, she always scream at me, and break my things, like two notebook computers, the door of my bedroom (yeah, she literally broke my door, so i can't close it), she insultes me calling me a hoe, and one thing that make me feel so bad she said she doesn't believe that I was raped, and that makes me question my own reality.

Recently I turned 17, in my birthday I tried get some pills while she was sleeping, but she woke up, so I couldn't had anything. I don't wanna die really, I mean, I wanna have a family and be happy but things can be difficult.
I don't go to class because when I go, I have anxiety attacks and panic attacks cause I feel that everyone is looking at me, and I'm annoying. And this difficult my learning, so I failed every class:(.
I don't have friends in the school, so I'm always alone and it's probably that I have those attacks. I'm so insecure. I don't want people see me cry, it's disgusting and I feel sick of myself.
I tried to go to psychology but they are so hostile with me and treat me like I'm a kid and says things like ""just go to the school"", and it's like  yeah, thanks for saying me the obvious part. So I don't wanna go anymore.

Btw, I can hang out with some friends I have, but it's punctual, like in my birthday or go to smoke some weed.

1jg9m8c,1742534825.0,"I’ve got a lot of things on my mind I’m 23, 24 in another month. I’ve got no job, no work history really, I’ve struggled these past 2-3 years to find employment, I’ve had interviews, nothing ever comes through. 
I’m broke, my mother pays for everything but I feel like such a burden I don’t even bother getting a haircut, I don’t bother getting new clothes, I damn near don’t even like doing laundry cuz she pays for all of it… that’s what a mother should do but the feeling I get doesn’t sit right with me.

I should be helping her more, I don’t drive, I’ve basically done absolute nothing with my life or in my life… 

She’s 60 boutta be 61 this year, she complains all day every day about various health issues, she also isn’t employed and has been putting flyers on cars for an income tax place, she busts her ass for whatever money she’s got and yet I drain it, certainly not all of it or large amounts but she still shouldn’t have to worry about my needs as well you know? 
Today she bought me a PS5 as an early birthday gift, she had the money to do so and wanted to, but here I am crying while she sleeps in the other room cuz of how shitty it feels feeling like I just costed her her life or something… this guilt that lives in me, this sense of burdening I feel, it’s killing me inside. Im trying to do better, become better, but nothing has happened, I’m frustrated, I’m hopeless, this world is hard to live in if you’ve got the right circumstances stacked against you. 
We are in a tough but tolerable spot, it’s not as dramatic as this may come across but it’s still weighing on my mind and has been since the day I turned 18.

She’s getting older and I can’t help but feel like I’m just killing her by having to work and support herself.. she also says she wants to work otherwise she’ll go crazy being home, she’s the type to over work herself so that helps make me feel at ease knowing this is something she also chooses or would prefer to be doing but still… she tells me she needs help. So idk wtf to think at times as well…

No one talks about being a young 20 something year old having elderly parents, my dad died when I was 13, he was 4 years her senior so he would’ve been 64 going on 65. 
No one talks how stressful it is to feel like ur in a rush to show them a lifetime worth of achievements and experiences, you wanna have a kid before they die, u wanna fall in love and be happy before they die and no one talks how difficult it is to juggle that with being a young adult who don’t even know himself let alone know wtf he wants to do in life. 

I feel like there’s this timer hanging above me everyday to figure out SOMETHING… the anxiety I feel 24/7 is horrible. I find myself laying in bed at night having to manually relax my shoulders and legs… it’s like I’m just tense all day till I sleep. 

I just wish I could feel like my life is paced how it should be.

I just want to clarify that I've suffered from various psychological disorders myself, so I completely understand my partners situation in many aspects.

Me and my partner have been together for 2 years but I've known him since we were  children. He was in a very bad relationship, for very long, before me with a partner who tried to commit suicide when they didn't get what they wanted, threatened him both verbally and physically. Their prior partner had borderline. 
When he finally managed to leave my partner was very broken down. This was about 7 years ago.

My partner is having a very hard time. For example waking up screaming in the middle of the night. Always tired and fatigued. Have a hard time expressing feelings and is often very apathetic. He barely enjoys anything in life. Very rarely i see him laugh anymore. He has been a victim of sexual abuse in his childhood but he has never told anyone except me, and he hasn't told me any details. Sometimes when he accidently thinks about his ex or his childhood he gets panic attacks but it's pretty rare. He has managed to shove his feelings so far down that he isn't affected by it most days. Problem is he's not affected by any feeling.

All in all he feels very unwell. I'm not a superhero so I can't handle this alone. I've tried to talk to him about getting help but he just says that he doesn't know what he would say and that he can't put feelings or thoughts into words anymore. I've said i could go with him if he's scared but he doesn't want that.

1jgclx1,1742548212.0,"Burnt out and exhausted on life Hi, I just found this subreddit. I appreciate the opportunity to share my candid feelings with others who might relate.

On paper, I'm a successful person who overcame the odds. I have experienced traumatic things (who hasn't?) My parents died at different times in my 20s, my dad to suicide, like his father. My oldest brother also killed himself 6 months after my mom passed. Nevertheless, throughout all of that I finished my terminal degree as a first generation college student, maintained meaningful relationships, lost 130lbs through diet and exercise, and built the foundation for a good career in a competitive field. 

Then, I realized my marriage wasn't going to work. Just to be clear, I'm still glad I left. Honestly it wasn't a bad relationship but we just couldn't see eye to eye. It was only three years, no kids, no big mess. 

And then I gained all my weight back and then some, totally on me for lack of discipline and indulging way too frequently in alcohol since I've hit my 30s.

But that's just it - I used to be able to 'whip myself into shape' literally and metaphorically. Now, I'm at a point where everything is anxiety and burdensome. This includes: taking a shower, washing my hair, brushing my teeth, grocery shopping, cleaning up my home, etc you get the picture. I self isolate and rarely see people unless it's work related or my one good friend. I don't take pleasure in anything like I used to anymore, not my personal work, movies, food, being active, and so on. 

I used to go to work, gym, cook from scratch, go hiking, traveling, made art and now other than work because I have to to survive, all of that is gone. 

I've been to multiple therapists and psychiatrists. I've tried Lexapro, Zoloft, Abilify, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Buspirone, Lithium, and others. I'm currently on Seroquel which I wish I wasn't because it's somewhat contributed to my weight and I now know how hard it is to ween off but I can't sleep without it. 

What do you do when you feel like you've experienced the best of life and nothing much better will ever come? I've accomplished everything I set out to do in my 20s - I moved to a big exciting city from my very small town, got my masters, have had personal and career achievements I never thought possible, had a ton of fun, and so on. One thing that scares me is that my sister recalls our dad saying something similar to her about his life. It's comforting on one hand to know that about your father after he died but terrifying to realize a similar thought process in yourself while holding on. 

I've suffered from suicidal ideation since my dad died - 13 years ago. One of the biggest things that keeps me at bay is knowing how devastating that pain is and I know there are people who care about me. The other one is logistics, couldn't even hang my fat ass in my place if I wanted to lol. 

But, I digress, I just don't really feel like I'll ever be able to enjoy life like I once did. I feel like I endure life more than live it.

1jgciwl,1742547841.0,"Not sure how to get over how my last relationship ended So my(34m) last relationship ended very badly. I’m not perfect, but I’m not abusive; verbally or physically, but I was treated as such.

I moved out of my apartment to go live with my ex (30f) because for the first year, we could only see each other once a week. When I suggested we move in together, I thought we should look for a place of our own. However, she was already on the title of her mom’s house and wanted to build an addition onto the property and live there. Made logical sense at the time, however, I wasn’t so crazy about the idea of living in such close proximity with her mom and sister… but I wanted to be with her every day, so I said yes.

Things were mostly okay for the first year and a half. She had a lot of emotional problems and put me through hell, but I stuck with it because I loved her. She got better with time. 

I got along alright with her mom but never got along with her sister. Her sister was a bitch. She was the kind of person who wouldn’t lift a finger to help with any projects or decorating but would be there when it was finished to criticize the work.

In early 2024, I lost a job that I tried really hard to get and it put me through a deep depression. But despite my state of mind I always: paid what I owed, did most of the chores, and always took care of her needs before mine. But I also was depressed and not in the mood for socializing. She started wanting to have her friends and family over every day to party and I’m just not a party person so I’d usually separate myself.

The day she broke up with me was horrible. It was a few days before her bday and I was going to be working on that day so I bought her and her friends tickets to the Queen Mary. I’d also recently applied for a Home Depot credit card to get her mom’s bathroom redone. Plus, I bought her presents and cupcakes from her favorite bakery which was an hour drive away.

I wanted to surprise her on the Sunday before her bday because she went to Mexico that weekend. After surprising her and going back to her house, she dropped the bomb on me that she felt we were drifting apart and wanted to breakup and I “had to see this coming”. I knew we were having trouble but I always thought if you truly loved someone, you would try to work it out. I guess that’s not a thing any more. 

So I didn’t take this news too well. Then I got really pissed off when she said she was going to let me stay there for half rent while I looked for another place. I should’ve stayed cool and said “well, you already owe me around $1100, how much time will that give me” but instead I said “No, I’m not wasting any more money on you!” And apparently that was enough for her to cut all emotional ties with me. She completely went off the rails and told me I had to get a U-Haul and leave now. This was 10PM at night so there was no place open and it was impossible but she was nuts.

It should be noted that we had a few bad fights before that where I offered to leave but she told me no. We were about to have her RN friend move in and she waited until that was near to drop the bomb on me, so I took this as her waiting for the .right moment to fuck me over, so I could keep providing my share of the rent.

Then she texted her mom and her mom came yelling at me saying “was it a waste!?” (Yes it was you dumb bitch!), “didn’t I tell you if you ever hurt my daughter, I’d get mad?!” (We never had such a talk btw). And she threatened to call the police on me even though I didn’t do anything wrong and lived there. But things were so hot and heavy I just decided to leave.

Before I left, my ex told me to give her her key which I did in the hopes that she might act reasonable and we could get this all over with. Biggest mistake of my life cause I found out later that I gave away my renters rights by that one little gesture. After leaving I asked if she could put my medication and bag on the driveway so I could get it. She threw it in the gutter for me. 

A couple days past and I was advised by a lawyer to go get my stuff as soon as I could because me handing that key over meant she could throw it all i. The streets. So I haphazardly assembled and team and UHaul.

I called some peace keeping officers to be there while I grabbed my stuff and for some reason those two fucking pigs decided to treat me as if I was a criminal and rushed me while I tried to pack all my stuff and leave. I was very close to going off on them but that just would’ve left me to get arrested. I think it was because her RN friend was there who’s one of those nasty evil people who uses everybody around her but can turn on the charm to fool anyone. She had all her friends there keeping watch as if I ever did anything petty to them before. Again. Never been abusive, never lied, never cheated… but I always thought of her needs before mine and this is how I’m getting treated?

8 months later and I’m still steaming about it. I feel like a huge injustice was done to me. I can’t understand how you could treat someone like that who gave you everything they had? It just goes to show you that a woman will treat an abusive charismatic man better than a nice introvert. Idk how to get over this. I’ve been seeing a therapist but she’s pretty worthless. I tell her all these things and I swear she’s not listening to me. I feel like I can’t trust women anymore because they don’t work on rational thinking. My mom told horrible lies about my dad because she was so upset at him and fucked him over too.

I just want revenge but I can’t attain it without just making myself look worse in the public eye. I don’t know how to get over this. I’m starting to doubt my own memories cause it’s like, I know I wasn’t perfect but I didn’t deserve all that. Or maybe I did. I don’t know what to think any more.


Tl;dr: I’m a mild manner nice guy who got treated like an abusive monster in my breakup with my ex and I don’t think I deserved it and I don’t know how to grapple with it.

I wanted to post this in the relationship community but it wouldn’t let me and it wouldn’t tell me why.

1jgcg2r,1742547501.0,"Is it alright for me to visit my depressed friend, if they are ghosting me? My best friend has been ghosting me since mid-November. The last actual text was in December to wish my happy birthday. I have been ghosted since then. I checked with others, and they too have been ghosted. 

I'm very worried about this friend. He is diagnosed with depression and it very cleary still affects him. He has ghosted me before in the summer of last year, though this is quite normal for him, as he never texts much during breaks. Anyway I moved out recently to go to college, so I have been unable to see him in person. I am currently back in town for semester break and wanted to see him at school. (He is a grade below me). Because of our school system, he will soon not have classes anymore (start of April) and I think it would be worse to show up unannounced at the place he lives in. 

Would it be a good idea for me to check up on him? Or would it be better to leave him alone? For the school thing I'd essentially pick up my younger sibling, to keep our time short, as I dont know if he would be alright with this.

1jgc40b,1742545918.0,"Face Sorry if this is incoherent, I’m a little out of it. But  this post is basically about being an ugly mfer lol. I should preface by saying I feel pathetic for having this issue as a man in college, when I shouldn’t be taking my time here for granted. However, this is eating away at my life, as crazy as it sounds.

The biggest source of anxiety and numbness for me is my face. Any shred of self acceptance or self love is crushed when I catch a reflection of my face randomly and realize how messed up I am. 

My eyes are the biggest issue because they are incredibly deep set, downturned, and fairly large/wide; the result is a set of creepy evil eyes. I notice this is worst under indoor lighting (and most lighting) which is 95% of the time for me. I also have natural creases under my eyes and a dent in my forehead, which make me look not only creepy but like I want to shoot myself all the time. 

Basically, I have a resting depressed + creepy face. I know this is not just in my head because people have commented on my appearance before. This may be partly confirmation bias, but people visibly avoid my gaze and even recoil when i try making eye contact. I could be completely content and calm and my face will look grotesque and drained of life and emotion. The fact that I am usually low energy around others and have little to no natural facial expressions (maybe in part due to my physical anxiety response) makes me a very unsettling and uncanny person to be around, and I feel incredibly isolated and lonely.

This wouldn’t bother me so much if I didn’t care how other people feel. I’m genuinely sorry for everyone who has to interact with me and get my negative face and energy. Seriously, no one deserves the evil eyes that I have. When I imagine other people having to work and interact with me, i want to disappear. 

I wear sunglasses whenever I can and eye contact is a huge issue for me as well. I’m so in my own head that I can’t even walk outside because I hate walking past people and having them see my face. I know I’m not important and many people won’t give too much of a shit about my creepy face, but I’d rather not go outside altogether and freak out unsuspecting strangers.

I also struggle with other symptoms: formulating sentences and listening is difficult for me, I have OCD over basic body functions, and sometimes things don’t feel real. But by far the issue of my face, which is completely out of my control, bothers me the most. I don’t plan on getting surgery, so I know the only thing I can do is accept my face as it is, but I hate making other people feel uncomfortable and burning my eyes into them. 

Lately Ive been skipping classes and other commitments because I’m way too anxious about this and other things, which only makes me more depressed and anxious. I’d rather not take up space around people at all, but obviously this is nearly impossible in the journey to fix mental health. If anyone has a similar experience, I’d be happy to get any advice.",1,2,0,"face sorry incoherent , little . post basically ugly mfer lol . preface saying feel pathetic issue man college , taking time granted . however , eating away life , crazy sounds . biggest source anxiety numbness face . shred self acceptance self love crushed catch reflection face randomly realize messed . eyes biggest issue incredibly deep set , downturned , fairly largewide result set creepy evil eyes . notice worst indoor lighting lighting 95 time . also natural creases eyes dent forehead , make look creepy like want shoot time . basically , resting depressed creepy face . know head people commented appearance . may partly confirmation bias , people visibly avoid gaze even recoil try making eye contact . could completely content calm face look grotesque drained life emotion . fact usually low energy around others little natural facial expressions maybe part due physical anxiety response makes unsettling uncanny person around , feel incredibly isolated lonely . would bother much care people feel . genuinely sorry everyone interact get negative face energy . seriously , one deserves evil eyes . imagine people work interact , want disappear . wear sunglasses whenever eye contact huge issue well . head even walk outside hate walking past people see face . know important many people give much shit creepy face , would rather go outside altogether freak unsuspecting strangers . also struggle symptoms formulating sentences listening difficult , ocd basic body functions , sometimes things feel real . far issue face , completely control , bothers . plan getting surgery , know thing accept face , hate making people feel uncomfortable burning eyes . lately skipping classes commitments way anxious things , makes depressed anxious . would rather take space around people , obviously nearly impossible journey fix mental health . anyone similar experience , would happy get advice ."

1jg5ogb,1742521373.0,"New to the community (+my experience with depression) Hi everyone, I recently joined this community after stumbling upon an old post from a few years ago and reading the comments on that post made me feel like this was a safe place to share my story.

It started back in January of 2022, when my grandmother fell I'll. We took her to the hospital one night when we noticed that she was jaundice. We didn't know what was going on until the results for her diagnosis revealed that she had pancreatic cancer. We were all pretty devastated, especially my dad and his sister (one of my aunts) and brother (my other uncle). For about 2 months, she's been suffering. The doctors were able to shrink the tumor enough to safely perform a Whopple procedure to completely remove the tumor. After the procedure, she seemed to be doing a whole lot better. During this time, I struggled to open up with anyone about my feelings and my struggles. Vulnerability wasn't easy for me. That all changes when I met my current boyfriend in May the same year. He was the first person to ever get me to open up about my feelings so he could support me better. I'm really glad he did because I don't know where I would be now if he hadn't. A while later, my family and I found out my grandmother's illness never went away like we thought. She was getting weaker and sicker. Since my dad, siblings and I lived with her, it was really hard to see her suffering the way she was. It was taking a toll on my mental health. Usually for Thanksgiving, we drive up to Holiday Inn Resort for vacation. We didn't want to do so that year due to my grandmother being ill but she insisted that we still go for vacation. While we were up there, we found out my grandmother had to be taken to the ICU as she went into cardiac arrest. We traveled back to the hospital where she was at the last day of our stay, and once we got there, seeing her tied up to many tubes and her not being able to move or speak or even being awake was traumatic. Luckily she survived at the time. We were at least able to spend one last Christmas with her before she passed away the day before New Year's Eve.I still remember the morning she passed. Since I lived next door to my aunt, I went over there screaming for her to come over. I started going to therapy after her passing and that's when I got diagnosed for severe depression. I kept attending therapy until September 2024 when I moved to Wisconsin with my boyfriend and we moved in with his mom. Because of therapy, I was able to manage my depression. But recently, my depression has came back and it hit me hard. I was supposed to have a secured job when I got to Wisconsin but the company turned around on me and said they didn't need people anymore, so I was out of a job. I had an interview at Five Below but they ended up rejecting me. Whatever jobs I could manage to get, would end up being terrible jobs. I worked at a gas station and they gave me full time hours even though I asked for part time hours since I was attending school. They knew I was attending school, so I switched to Wal-Mart. I worked as a Digital Personal Shopper there and I sustained a severe knee injury which kept me from working. I ended up being jobless for a few months. My knee recovered but I was struggling to even find another job. I was getting stressed out since I have almost $2,000 of medical bills to pay off, and I have a cat that I'd rather die than lose him to take care of. I began feeling worthless, like I wasn't good enough to get a good job. My boyfriend andI wanted to help my boyfriend's mom pay her housing expenses, especially since she helped us out tremendously. I felt like a huge disappointment and burden for not being able to do so. I felt like I didn't even deserve her kindness. I then finally got a job at Jimmy Johns and at first things were going good, but they started overhiring people and my hours got cut by alot as a result. So now I've been trying to find a better job that pays better and will give me better hours but it's been really hard. Today I had a mental breakdown, which ended up including s*icide ideation and self h*rm. I've been depressed all day and I feel guilty about harming myself because I knew my boyfriend would be sad if I did (I self harmed before in the past and he's asked me to try not to do it again). I felt like he was disappointed when I decided to tell him. He said he wasn't, he's just worried for me. I'm honestly getting to the point in my life where I don't care about anything anymore. I don't want to be alive. I haven't felt happy in months and I'm running out of reasons to keep fighting. My boyfriend wants me to keep fighting but I really can't. I don't know how much longer I can take all of this. I'm spiraling out of control. I have no motivation for anything anymore. It feels like I'm being punished. I'm currently attending therapy again, I had my first appointment with my new therapist on Monday, which honestly wasn't too bad. My next appointment is in 2 weeks and I don't even think I'll make it by then. I want to tell my therapist I've been self harming and having s*icide ideation but I don't want to be hospitalized for it. I'm not sure what to do anymore. I don't have hope anymore. There's not enough good in my life to give me more reasons to keep fighting. Any happiness I did feel in the small moments have been completely consumed by my feelings. I feel trapped inside a cage I cant get out of. It feels like my only way out is s*icide. However, it would be selfish of me to go out that way because I know it would cause pain for the ones I love. I can't put my dad through more grief than what he's dealing with now. But I feel like I have no other way out. There's really no other solution that I can think of. I feel numb half the time. I feel more tired and lethargic. I don't want to do anything anymore. I h*te my life.

1jg4sfp,1742518623.0,"Depressed But Also Revved Up Recently. Confused 28F: Not sure what I am looking for here, maybe just to vent and hear other people’s potentially similar stories? I know that there cant be any medical advice given, so am not looking for that.

I have multiple diagnosed conditions (depression, ocd, anxiety) but do not have bipolar disorder. I have been evaluated multiple times for things over the years and it has never been a concern, however am on some typically bipolar meds due to treatment resistant depression. 

For the first time ever I am experiencing what I can only assume some form of mania feels like for the last two weeks, while still also being super depressed. 

I have been speaking fast (noticed by multiple people and told to slow down), overbooking myself with multiple conflicting things at the same time over and over again, not taking breaks at work and just working through it, eating less, jittery, shaky, racing thoughts, jumping from one thing to another, rushing around and bumping into things, etc. As a result of being “revved up” my ocd compulsions and self harm have both increased ( disclaimer: I am being as safe with that as possible/no current safety risk). I am still sleeping “normally”(which is poor sleep).

1jg8tkf,1742531736.0,"It’s Never Got This Bad, I’m Not Sure What To Do,  I Might Kill Myself. Hello, for context I'm a 19 year old women in online college. I have a physical disability in my eyes due to me being albino (I'm black.) other than my eyes that shake, I've never seen much wrong with my appearance as a kid despite being bullied. In elementary school most kids were chill with me and didn't cause me problems besides asking questions about my eyes. When i was in middle school and high school I faced a awful amount of bullying. I hated going to school, and the friends I had defended the bullying around me and didn't help much. I got called names, picked on, asked on dates as a joke and had stuff thrown at me. I genuinely wanted to crash out but I didn't want to be sent to juvenile hall. In high school the bully calmed down, but I was lonelier than ever, and my in real life friends felt distant and only came to me with their problems except one I have in present time. 
All this bullying made me quest my appearance so much in my senior year. Even though it calmed down, many kids still picked on me. I was still asked out as jokes and people made fun of me. A girl called me pretty when I wore makeup but I don't understand. I had so many conflicting thoughts ""Am I pretty?"" ""Am I ugly?"" I have no idea. I don't like to look at my face in the camera or the mirror. I honestly hate myself and feel like I'm a monster. I feel like I shouldn't be seen outside because I make people too uncomfortable to talk to me . Most people look at my eyes and just treat me so bad or laugh at me. I don't want my online boyfriend(he lives in the same state a few mins away) to see me and I don't want to see myself either. I feel like there's no where for me to turn and I don't understand what steps to take. I've cried for so many months and have been depressed in my room after my graduation. 
My only motivation is to work out, but I feel like that won't even work? What if I'm still ugly? 
I know no one can fix my problems and I'm not sure how I can either, but I feel so alone. I needed to rant.

1jg8agv,1742529804.0,"I can’t end it myself but day dream about the ways someone else could do it for me I’ve been depressed for as long as I can remember. When I was 9 I shattered a mug I had made in pottery class and sliced my hand open out of anger. Didn’t even know what cutting was at the time, I just snapped and wanted to feel physical pain. I hid the extent of my pain for years. 16 to be exact. It’s always been on and off, thought it was bipolar for a while but realized I’m just always going to be depressed. I’ll go through phases where 2/3 months out of the year I’m working out regularly, taking care of my body, on a great schedule and in a good mental state then it just goes back to normal. 

I was neglected growing up, a result of being a child of divorce and a heroin addict mother who hid it from me for majority of my life (I only found out this year how bad her addiction really is). I am very lucky I have a dad who is able to financially support me though it hasn’t always been great between us either. I’ve realized after years how much he was affected by my mother as well and how it caused and awkward strain on our relationship. 

Having to go to work and smile all day is exhausting. I burn out at every job I’ve had. I have a college degree from a great school but my brain really just doesn’t allow me to function like other people. I’ve never had a passion for anything and all I think about it being alone in bed and only feel safe when I’m in my room. 

Ive always found comfort in the idea that I can just end it whenever I want. But the guilt of potentially causing a similar pain to inflict my peers holds me back. I feel sick thinking about people mourning me and the pain it would cause. I’ve always had great friends even though we don’t all live in the same place anymore. I have cousins that are like siblings. I wouldn’t want them to feel guilty, truly there is nothing anyone can do. One of my best friends mothers committed suicide a few years ago and I’ve seen how her personality and life has changed drastically. I also cringe that people would remember me as weak or damaged. I’ve always done a good job at putting on a smile and a facade that I’ve been performing for 16 years. People would describe me as goofy and giggly. I hate feeling pity which has led me to keep everything inside. I just hate the way I’d be remembered as someone who committed suicide. I just wish someone would do it for me. An accidental car crash would be ideal.

1jg3yuv,1742516160.0,"I think im falling back into a deep depression but I don't have help Here's the TL;DR if you don't wanna read: moved in with my bf and quit my job after not being able to pay rent. Now I feel like nothing matters anymore and I dont have the energy to clean or do anything.

So basically, I'm (22 ftm) depressed again (whoopdy-f'n-doo). I didn't think I'd be back in this cloud since I got out of it after high school. The entirety of my middle and high school years were just awful. Both at school and at home I had nowhere to just hide. So I buried myself in the internet between all the awful things happening around me.

It tool me until I cut off my family a couple years after graduation HS that I felt better. I felt free. Now I had a job, my own apartment and- literally nothing else. I had been barrels from coming back to my hometown because my parents had me under the impression they would try to pry their way back into my life.

So, now, living in a new town, no friends, just coworkers, and almost none of my belongings to my name. Even tho I had very little, I had money and plenty of food. And I was actually happy. I had energy, I was feeling happier in my body (aside from dysphoria).

Then I met my current bf last year in July. We dated for a couple months and I started going to his place more often, as I had really nothing at mine. No TV, wifi or games. Just a blow-up mattress and a plastic tub of items that I needed along with clothes. I had a blast hanging out with him. I still love him very much and I'm happy with him.

Until at my work I found out we were getting our overtime cut which meant the extra money that was helping me get by just enough in rent was gonna cause me to be late on payments. It's the only job i could get that paid the amount it did so this was a punch in the gut.

My bf decided, ""hey, you can move in with me, I own my own place, I dont mind."" I said ok and we started the process of moving my stuff to his overtime. Eventually I put in my 30 days notice and never went back. Never got my deposit but I didn't care.

I still went to work but after a while it was getting a bit much to drop me off and come get me. I can't drive and Uber is expensive. And on top of all that, at my work, they decided to drop a bunch of extra stuff on us to do that was only for show to the customers (I worked in a cafeteria). It would cause too mush disruption for the workers, extra work, and yet they wouldn't let us have overtime. An influx of 2 week notices came through. I knew if I stayed I would suffer, so I did the same.

Before I did this, my bf said if I ever wanted to quit my job, I could as long as I just help around the house. I'm fine with that, I've done that in the past for other people (couchhopping) and had no problem with it. In fact, I love cleaning. I love looking back at all the work I've done and seeing how neat everything looks.

But now, I don't know what's happening. I just feel this cloud over me. Always feeling lethargic, nauseous, anxious and wanting to cry every day. I should mention I started taking T back in December. Being trans in the US isn't helping my mental state either but I don't wanna go into the politics of that.

I just wanna find some kind of motivation now. In the past I've found something that helped. Even if it was small. But now I'm out of motivation. I have nothing left in me anymore. I've gained a bunch of weight, I had an episode and cut my hair so now it looks shitty. I can't fit into any of my clothes anymore and I just feel awful. I've been cutting down on food more than I should. And my acid reflux acts up when I dont eat for long periods of time. Don't even say anything about exercise, I tried that by taking walks in the neighborhood only to get groped by a stranger.

We can't afford meds. Therapy. Nothing that will help. I just have this urge to pack up and leave. But I'm happy so I don't know why.

1jg6kgy,1742524111.0,"I’ve been depressed since 19. I’m 27 now and these are my strategies to not let it consume me Depression runs genetically in my family. It got worse when I stopped believing in god and became socially isolated. I was also bullied for the first time in my life by my college community.

There were times that I’d cut ppl out of life, cry every night and contemplate self harm. I’ve hit myself a lot too to try to get out of depression. I’ve destroyed gifts ppl have given me and ruined a lot of my things. I thought feeling pain would help me.

Here’s what helped me:
- Being busy. People underestimate the healing power of getting out of the mess of one’s dark thoughts and focusing on a task one at a time. I was in college and had a lot of course work and was working part time so I couldn’t afford to be depressed. 

- Eating everyday. I struggle with this to this day. I have no interest in food. I eat the minimal and doctors have told me that I’m borderline anorexic. I force myself to eat everyday. I know that if I don’t eat, I’ll pass out and want to die.

- Listening to music while walking or working out. Do this at least 3 times a week. My body needs exercise and if I stay cooped inside and static, it will make me think and I hate being in my mind when I’m depressed. Also good chemicals get released and it helps me go on for another day.  

- Living one day at a time. When I’m depressed, I don’t want to think about life. I try to focus on the present and if get through one more day, it’s a huge win!

- Finding a way to express the depression. I draw and recently started journaling. It helps me have a safe space to let out the darkness that I’m feeling without any fear of judgment.

 - Feeling needed. This can be as simple as feeding a stray cat. When someone depends on me, it gives me strength to get out of a rut. 

- Crying, laughing, trying to feel again. Ive collapsed crying so many times that I’ve lost count but holding it in feels like a burden. I cry before going to bed or when driving. 

- Sunlight. I sit in the sun for 10 min everyday. This is really important! Please do this even if you do nothing else!

- Binging a show. When I’ve hit rock bottom, I just watch something because thinking and feeling things is too hard. I know I’ll go deeper into depression so I hold off processing until I’m stronger.

- Understanding that it’s ok to be depressed. It will probably never go away and it’s not your fault. I tell this to myself constantly. I refuse to let depression wreck my life. I can choose to build my life where I can still be somewhat happy. 

- Therapy, therapy and therapy! I’ve never gone to therapy at my darkest times. I’ve always had to force myself back up. I’ve realized that I should’ve seen a therapist. If you can’t afford therapy, use chat gpt or a friend. 

Despite all these strategies, I still feel depressed. Just two years ago I spent two months crying, throwing up and not eating properly. I abused drugs and alcohol several times to numb myself. 

Even now I’m going to through a whole depression spiral, but I’m so used to these episodes that I won’t let it take over my life.

I have work and bills to pay. I have a family that relies on me. I have friends that I’m so grateful for that even when I’m at my lowest I will go see because I know even though I don’t want to leave my room, it’ll make me feel better. 

I wish you all the best on your journeys. Depression isn’t something that disappears overnight and no we can’t just be happy. Depression is a terrible gray fog that clouds the mind. 

I just want you to know that we all deserve to pursue happiness. It’s not easy for us depressed folks but I believe everyday counts. You are the master of your fate, the captain of your soul!

1jg6jiu,1742524036.0,"I have a lot on my mind It doesn't feel like I can reach out to anyone and I need an outlet that I could possibly just hear something from someone. It feels attention seeking but who really cares if I rant on some throwaway account.


I'm not sure what l've been doing for the past week besides maybe yesterday? But then again the more I think about it I don't even remember yesterday. I feel like I'm going insane. I shouldn't be unaware of what I did Wednesday on Thursday. Time has been flying by, and initially I didn't even realize. I just kinda let it happen. This isn't the first time l've felt like an outsider to my own life, and I'm positive it won't be the last. I can tell you what l've done today somewhat confidently but I'm sure that tomorrow all I can say is ""well I went to school."" Its scary even to think about the fact that I can experience an entire week and only recall maybe one or two things, and the worst part is I don't even know if I'm just making shit up and going crazy but then again if I was making it up I probably wouldn't feel this way to begin with.

tonight has been especially rough on me. I keep thinking about the past and how I could've done things differently, which thinking back on it now with a slightly clearer conscious is stupid to think. Both of my parents were addicted to several drugs, they neglected me emotionally and for a period of time physically.
My nana stepped in and took over, bless her soul, but she lived with us already so you can imagine how that didn't quite change things. I was still 10 years old trying to keep 2 adults from killing each other, quite literally, things became physical often. Sometimes when I think about the past I go down this train of thought where I just recall things that have been buried deep in the back of my mind.
Despite this there are things I can't quite remember, things that others around me have told me definitely happened but I just can't seem to recall it. It's easy to see how a home life like that could contribute to the development of suicidal thoughts. Especially when your parents come to you with those same thoughts, you can't help but wonder how right they are to have them. Sorry I'm rambling.
Anyways, when you're a child there isn't a lot you can do about the life you've been born into. I can't go back and make my parents undo meth or heroin or anything else they did that I don’t know about to this day. I know someone used needles OFTEN because the first time they went to jail (didn’t last long) we cleaned the bathroom, there’s a hole in the wall from an argument where my dad got mad or whatever the hell happened that night, anyways when we broke into the wall there were just needles upon needles upon needles. Whether it was my dad or his girlfriend at the time or my mom was unclear but chances are it was a mixture. 

I’d like to believe I’m a good student. All 80s-90s. I don’t fall behind often. It’s a miracle I’m able to do that. Sometimes I just see it as my only escape, the only way I’ll ever make it out of this filth ridden house. Not sure if I should take the route of complaining about how disgusting my house has become over the years or if I should complain about spiraling out over failure. I’m still a minor, if that wasn’t clear, 2 more years til freedom. Not sure where I’m gonna go but I can’t stay here. I just can’t. My house is a filthy mess. It’s gotten better with some slight effort but I’m not willing to clean outside of my room. I’d say my room is decent as of right now, I’ve definitely gotten better about cleaning it. The worst it’s gotten I had plates stacked rotting away, an unclear walkway on my floor that only I could really navigate, and a mountain of clothes on the floor that I would rotate wearing. Back to the house itself though, we have countless holes in the walls from the angry fits of a 30 something year old man child. The sink is something I don’t even want to know. I think someone just started washing them recently, which is pretty awesome. I miss having silverware. my dad who is out of jail from 1 years worth of time being there, which imo he should’ve never been allowed back into this house let alone back out of jail, but I digress. He leaves things dirty. filthy. absolutely rancid. joked to me one time “you know I don’t clean” yeah asshole I know. Shaves and doesn’t clean the sink, which because of the state of the kitchen sink the bathroom sink is my only hope for washing my hands or brushing my teeth, both habits I’m trying to improve. So obviously I clean the sink. And the toilet. And the shower. Basically I clean the bathroom because we need that. 

the second to last thing I’ll complain about is the ptsd I’ve gained from everything that’s happened. I wake up often drenched in sweat confused and scared shitless. Prozasin has somewhat calmed the storm at nighttime, but during the day is a lot different. I can’t do yelling, sometimes just yelling alone but often what gets me is when it sounds aggressive. My heart skips a beat and I have to sit down to breathe properly. Tears will flood my eyes and I’ll have to sit there and convince myself nothings wrong, that things have been better for a while now. Even though it doesn’t actually feel that way and quite frankly it never has. My mom is in jail now which once again, about a year since her arrest. So things haven’t even been “better” all that long when I think about it. I wish during that time I would’ve worked on myself more rather than just becoming more and more unstable. I became more impulsive and occasionally took a few extra pills in a pissy fit, luckily the worst thing to happen was an extreme discomfort for a good 12 hours. Suicidal ideation has become something im more comfortable talking about through therapy. Which can be seen as good or bad. But honestly it’s been nice to be able to ask those closest to me for help or just distraction when I need it. Obviously I don’t just go “hey so I’m thinking about killing myself lol wanna play a game with me!!” It’s more of a “hey I could use a distraction rn, do you have time?”. 

last thing, I promise. I doubt anyone has read to here, but if you have hi and thank you for listening to my long ass rant. Just writing this has calmed me down some. but anyways, life with my dad out of jail has certainly been something. There was the first 3 months where he was good. He contributed to bills, which he runs up because he doesn’t turn lights off, he had a job, and he was spending time with me and my brother. I was able to find out a lot about things I didn’t know because I was left in the dark for so many years, and I was naive to trust him for giving me that information. Was it true? probably. it was all plausible and he never tried to paint himself in a good light. It was honest and vile and hard to hear. but my mistake was just allowing him to creep back into my life. He’s never home anymore, he has this little girlfriend or whatever she is to him. He asks for money from my nana who just keeps on giving and giving. Sometimes I feel insane because I’m the only person who thinks we should not trust him or enable him or supply him with shit. What has he done to deserve that now? add an extra phone to the phone bill? Run the electricity bill through the roof when he is home? Yell at me on several occasions knowing damn well it was gonna send me spiraling? Steal 700 dollars from my nana? who by the way at 79 years old is a waitress at Waffle House. just imagine. 

I’m splitting this into 2 for easier reading, but I don’t think he deserves the title of father or dad or any other words even remotely close. I don’t think he should be called a man either, dipshit has beat on several women including my mom. I’ve had to beat him with a pipe to get him to stop choking her. Apparently he may or may not have hit his girlfriend thing recently. I remember one time I told him he wasn’t a good father to his kids and he definitely wasn’t a good son to his mother. Back in 2020-2022, somewhere in there, he threw a large rock at her windshield. big ole circle right where it hit. He’s never hit me past spankings as a kid, which I also don’t condone personally but whatever it’s not that serious and I know that. But I fear him. My mom when out of jail and messed up wasn’t much better than my dad in the context of parenting, but one line she never crossed was initiating any sort of physical violence, the times she did hit my dad was purely self defense. Anyways I fear him because I know he has the potential somewhere in him to lay his hands on me. I still sleep with that metal pipe thing in the crack of my bed, it gives me a sense of security. He admitted to relapsing to my aunt, which my cousin reported to me because she was right beside them and overheard it all. I can’t live like that again, once almost killed me and twice sure as hell will do it.

1jg0xj9,1742508029.0,"I screwed up and I have no idea what to do Hi there. Been ADHD diagnosed since I was a kid (I'm a woman), but it's not until recently that I, and my doctors, understood that ADHD was also the culprit for a lot of my emotional dysregulation or failure to regulate. I remember doctors telling me when I was a kid, ""You're on medicine to help you focus, and now we need to figure out where your temper comes from."" When I get stressed and/or depressed, I lash out. ADHD is an explanation but not a justification or an excuse, I know that. I have been trying to work on it for years with obviously varying success. I also have depression and anxiety and am on meds for that.

I am dealing with an awful personal situation, in addition to stress and regular depression and anxiety about our world, and I made two very dumb mistakes at work that were unprofessional. They didn't lead to losing money or anything like that, it's about relationships. Now I'm worried I may lose my job. I've already been trying to figure out for the past year how to leave this job and what I want to do with my life -- I'm in my late thirties, an attorney who's never done 'real' law -- but I need health insurance for my ADHD and depression meds.

I just feel like such a failure. I'm old but I feel like an immature kid who can't control my temper, and now I may just be a jobless, single, failure of a person.

1jg3ex7,1742514596.0,"Is my mother bad or is it my fault for everything? I don't even know where to start. She always tells me what basic needs thing to do like ""go brush your teeth"" or ""do you want to eat"" every 20 minutes. She thinks that the computer and phone are the fault for everything. 

My conflicts with her started around the fall of 2022 when I was 11. On one day it was 10pm but i wanted to play for 15 minutes on my computer. She started yelling and screaming that it's too late. (Just know that I don't remember a lot and my english has become worse over time). I think I turned on my computer or i was trying to and me and my mother kept yelling at eachother. Eventually she might have hit me or pushed me or grabbedme or something. It was a very loud arguement. Also my dad starts hitting me whenever i scream and argue with my mom. He charges at me and hits me with a lot of force a few times. When I am not arguing and it's a ""normal"" day he is a good dad but with a few cons which i won't explain. 

Eventually they called the police and the fucking police officer started yelling at me how i was not listening and that i haven't been ""disciplined"" enough. By that he meant i was not hit enough times as a kid. After that i got in an ambulance and i got driven to the hospital. During that time my mother was crying, but not from remorse, but from what happened. She doesn't think that screaming and yelling at your kid and even hitting it is bad for their mental health. She thinks that my ""computer addiction"" is what caused all of that (even the yelling). After that i started going to a psychiatrist because otherwise it would have been illegal not to go. Also my mother started taking me to a psychologist as well. There, the psychologist was telling me that the arguements about my screen time are all of my fault and ""but it's your mother"" type shit. Everyone was telling me that every problem with my relationship with my parents is because of my computer and me.

Also my parents put me an app on my phone and pc that restricts how much time i can spend on the devices. That also caused an arguement because of course i don't want someone to be monitoring what i am doing and for how long I'm doing it. And when that happened my mother started abusing this power and locked my devices when i started arguing with her which made me even more angry. 

From 2022 to now i had to express fake love because she always cries and feels sad when i have an arguement with her. Everytime only I was apologizeing to her and she never did to me. It was always my fault. After i turned 14 i felt how my brain is more developed thatn it was from 12-13 years old. I now started to realize that my mom just can't handle truths or that she is guilty for my bad mental health. Sure, i might not be depressed only from my toxic relationship with her, but because of having little or no friends, but the constant yelling, being ""sad"" and insulted, abusing her parent's rights, manipulating other stupid people like her into being on her side entirely and attacking me in group of how i am guilty for all of the bad things that happen at home is 99% of the reason for me having bad mental health. Now I see that she is immature and doesn't understand that I'm a fucking teenager and i don't need her telling me to eat, go to bed or brush my teeth 

(about the eating part- my family doesn't usually eat together. It's very individual who eats when. So when i am having breakfast for example and i have already made my breakfast she asks me if i want cheese or something. I tell her that if i have wanted cheese i would have gotten it, but she gets really offended and tells me that i am ungreatful and that i don't understand that she cares about me. Im fucking 14 years old i understand that you care about me bitch.)

Also she still thinks that the computer is everything's fault. For almost 3 years she hasn't changed. Maybe 5 because i was having bad arguement with her even in 2020. When i come home i feel off. It doesn't feel right for me to talk with her. I have to pretend that i love her and that i am happy at the moment. Usually we scream at eachother every week so i basically have no relationship with her.

Recently I started feeling hopeless for my future. A few weeks ago I was on a school trip where I could be my true self. I felt like i am not normal for my age and my social skills are of that of a 12 year old. I feel like that living with a retard bitch ruins my social skills especially when I am conditioned that everything i say will be used against me. That hopelessness is now leading me into considering killing myself. I got extremely depressed a few days ago after i had another stupid arguement with my mother about an F in maths. The next days i felt like moving is not needed and i started not eating even when it felt like i have a hole in my body. I just couldn't go to school because i didn't see a point in doing anything. Not even not seeing a point in life but anything. I just didn't feel shit. We had to go to my GP to get my absence from school excused and there my mother started crying like a 2 year old how she doesn't understand what's wrong with me. Of course she manipulated the doctor and she got on my mom's side and started scolding me. I also started cutting my hands a few days prior.

Love is absolut garbage. There is this one girl I had extreme feelings for and everything was ok. She didnt want a relationship because of her last one at the moment and I respect that. But why do I need to be played with like an idiot?
We cuddled and kissed before, me aleeping at her place cuddled against her... last time she invited me to stay and sleep at her place, so we watched a movie and I tried gently placing my arm on her leg she immediatly kicked it away. Than later I tried to comfort her and rub her shoulder when she came closer but all the did is yell at me to stop.
Never explained or anything 

I feel like a joke.

1jg1eqx,1742509238.0,"I'm lost. I'm not used to talking about myself
Nor about my discomfort, but I know no one here and I tell myself that it's good because I need to talk. 
Being a victim of incest (if my publication bothers me I will delete it) from the age of 6 until I was 13, I quickly fell into depression. I did not have a healthy home, my parents argued and separated a lot as well as being abusive. 
I quickly had to deal with a lot of things such as taking care of my little brothers and sisters like a mother when I didn't have to do it (I'm talking about showers, changing diapers, going to bed, feeding etc.) on the side, I was given nothing, no attention and I was attacked by the one I thought was my big brother. 
Finally, when I went to 4th grade (college. At the reunion) I denounced the facts to my nurse by force, after seeing one of my little sisters experience what I was experiencing. So everything comes together. Moving to France, police, ect. He was imprisoned, I fell into depression. 
A depression so bad that I was hurting myself. I cut myself, everywhere, without limits. I wrote entire pages for my parent where I explained to her that if they didn't help me, I would end up committing suicide. 
She read it, and said, “I can’t fucking do anything, it’ll be better tomorrow.” 
On this, I followed up with school bullying, scarification, depression, hyper sexualization, nightmare and disorder. 
Then in 2022, I did the irreparable, I attempted suicide. 
My mother found me the next day, she told my father, distorting everything, and my father yelled at me in the car, calling me selfish.
The hospital followed, the psychologist, I gained weight and in October 2023 I saw my attacker again at my trial where everything did not go very well, he did not even recognize my rapes, just the touching (he had a total of 13 victims). 
Over all this, my sisters had their “victory” but I cannot rebuild myself..
At the same time I was dating this boy, and he raped me. I fall lower, I want to die. I hurt myself, and I barely eat because people call me fat. 
In 2024, I manage to get out of this toxic relationship and I'm trying to get better, I lost a few kilos but they call me a whale. 
For a moment I hurt myself more even though I know I'm not happy either.
Except that recently, since last month I have fallen further down. (You should know that my parent and my father have separated for good, I no longer see my big sister, another of my big brothers and some of my little brothers and sisters due to the family conflict that separates us) And that made me relapse. I hurt myself, and I can't stop, I can't do it anymore. 
I want to disappear. Plus being there, escaping this everyday life. 
At the moment, I hate myself even more for my appearance, I no longer go out with a great guy who I thought loved me but I just understood that he loved another, more beautiful woman. 
Sometimes, Ok em says that I'm beautiful only to be fucked. I feel like I am society's toy and pain. 
However, I just wanted to live normally, to be loved and happy. 
This is what I wanted.

Any kind of pain or anything that didn't make me feel good, I didn't want a single part in. I was exposed to sexual things constantly and only cared about how I looked. All I wanted was to get older so I could be an adult and smoke and do whatever I want and get a boyfriend or girlfriend or whatever. Very small minded wishes. I was super weak.
Now, when I turned 10, I joined Discord. (No, it's not a grooming story) And met a girl I will call Frog. It was an Eddsworld fan server, and she became my first real close best friend. Never having someone to be vulnerable with before, you can probably see where this is going. I was completely attached, and our relationship and friend group was absolutely PLAUGED with drama. We would get in fights almost daily, share interests, block each other, cry, vent to eachother, and after a few months I found myself beginning to actually love her. Loving a peer for the first time. Now, it was platonic, and I was actually starting to think about my life and who I really was. I found out I was trans. Instead of that clean aesthetic girl vibe I loved, I started to love more cartoons and rap music. Things like BROCKHAMPTON, 2Pac, Tomska, beastie boys, Boondocks, Minecraft YouTubers, and for the first time I actually started to like who I was. I could see myself being kinder and 'cooler'. However, this wasn't a very dead set feeling yet so bear with me. 
Around summer of 2021, we were both 11 and while logging off of Minecraft with her, I took a shower, and it set in. I'm in love with my best friend. As these feelings developed, I realized I would do anything for this girl. I would toughen myself up, be whatever she wanted me to be, 'man' up, be kinder, be a better person, and stop being so sensitive. I did all these things, and while talking to her all day every day, she began to like someone else. 
Late 2021, it was my first year of middle school and she had a crush on this boy I will call Franklin. I HATED Franklin with every inch of my body, I couldn't stop thinking about it. And while she became more depressed, I became more and more hopeless and jealous and constantly anxious. I would text her asking if we were still friends, and barely ever get responses from her. She only cared abour him and it broke me. One day, she stopped responding and logging onto anything. It was weeks, and not a single peep from any of her accounts. 
This wouldn't have affected me as much if I didn't do what I'm about to say, but I completely devoted myself to her. I centered my life at the age of 12 around one person and one person only. I made myself a living puppet, only liked what she liked, I was completely in love and absolutely nothing else mattered anymore. I was so depressed I would wake up, and the first thought would be I hate myself and I just want Frog. I was nothing without her, everything is about her, I would throw up crying, force myself to not change to the point I was constantly delirious/ derealizing, and even started cutting myself. I thought about killing myself, how I used to be, and it really hit me how much I changed. I became hard, nothing else besides her could really make me cry or feel negative, the bullying from my peers stopped making me bat a single eyelash, and I lost over 50 pounds I would never eat. This led to very messed up teeth, irritable bowel syndrome, OCD (real OCD, not the ones where people say omg I need my house to be clean teehee! No, if my brain told me to burn my skin off or else she would leave me, I would do it) and an adjustment disorder. A lot of other bad things happened, but I will leave that at that.
To summarize the last part of this, we dated, she broke up with me and I almost killed myself, I couldn't get out of bed, I started to hate her, I gave up on a lot of my dreams, we got back together, I was a bitch to her but I only wanted her, I started to form a backbone and December 2023 at 14 years old was like ok. Bye I hate you. And now at 15, we are friends. But there is a huge issue that will not leave me alone. 
2024, I allowed myself to make other friends and actually enjoy what I naturally wanted to enjoy. It was weird, and it made me very guilty, but my mental health got better. I don't know when, but my depression left, I became a person again, my morals loosened, but now, I can't stand myself. 
I never imagined a future without her in it, and I never wanted to go back to who I was before I became depressed. I formed a sense of self, I knew who I was and did whatever it took to never change. And now that I have a big social circle, loving friends, a better life, and I fucking hate it so much. I wish I killed myself when I was 12. 
I was so mentally strong that I completely do not feel certain emotions anymore. That is NOT an exadduration, I do not feel anger or lust and I haven't for years really. Lust expecially, I still felt a little anger towards Frog. I can't stand change, I'm not depressed anymore and I don't know what to do. I absolutely thrive in chaos and stress, I'm in a court case because I believed something that was a completely lie, I'm under house arrest, I have an eating disorder, I do everything I can to make me miserable and it's never enough. I'm still not depressed. I don't feel stressed and I can't stand it. 
Watching shows like The Owl House, Amphibia, Arcane, I wish I could live in situations like theirs. Poverty, street fights, extreme guilt, paranoia, having no access to food, etc. I know it sounds selfish since people in real life deal with this, but I don't feel like myself at all. I never want to change and I refuse to change and get healthier. I don't want a better life for myself anymore like I did when I was 10, all I want to do is make myself get worse or die. But sitting here typing this, I'm not even sad and it's eating me alive. I just want to be depressed again. I don't feel like myself and I don't know what to do.

1jg0kdz,1742507093.0,"Hopelessly Lost I hate my life so much. I wake up everyday hating myself for being such a failure. 

On the outside I seem ok. I got my degree in Chemical Engineering (3.3 GPA) and after 9 months of looking for a job I finally got one job at a manufacturing plant in Quality. 

There is absolutely ZERO engineering in this job, I get paid very shitty given my degree and the many achievements I have along the way (Six Sigma Black Belt, CQE, Internal Audit Certified, EIT certificate, etc.). But I had to take the job or else I wouldn’t have anything. I get mistreated by the vast majority of my coworkers and none of my ideas even get considered (let along implemented). 

I have applied to over 220 jobs in the last 7 months (3 interviews), had my resume professionally redone 4 times, and made several cover letters personalized to these areas. 

If it wasn’t for my wonderful gf I honestly might have killed myself by now. Unfortunately, if I don’t get another job that can support both of us, then she will have to go back in 6 months to her home country. 

I feel like all this hard work I’ve put in has all been for nothing. My parents say I’m just a crybaby and I need to pull myself up from my bootstraps like they did and that any emotional outburst is considered a sign of weakness. 

I really do want to kill myself, but I have a sliver of hope that things will change. Unfortunately, that sliver gets smaller every day and it may completely close. I really need to figure out what I’m going to do with my life. I need an opportunity THATS IT. I don’t want a free job, but I want somebody in my long job search to just acknowledge me and give me a legitimate chance to succeed. I know I can, but I feel hopelessly lost and broken. 

I can’t go on like this. Please tell me I’m not the only one.

1jfym9g,1742502206.0,"What do I do? So I got my diagnose recently. I honestly did not expect it to be depression, but here I am. A little bit of background: I live in Germany (a pretty depressing country on it's own tbh) for the past 10 years with my family and they don't speak the language, so I've been doing most of the translating work since pretty young age. Had to give up on many hobbies moving here and just at the age of 13 I was dealing with all of the adult stuff my parents had to do (and also some more private things concerning the relationship between my parents, but I won't get into that).

 Now in my 20s I've come to a point where I live on my own (or with my bf to be more specific) and decided to try therapy because of some of the issues I had in my relationship. I was honestly expecting something like social phobia or adhd and not depression, but apparently all of my symptoms align. I always felt bad in a way, but that felt so normal. I thought through the experience I have made being basically the adult in the family, it's normal to feel sad every other day and to feel so overwhelmed to the point you'd wish to just not be around anymore, but apparently it is not. 

 After moving away from my parents I got a lot more free time on my hands and that free time started to overwhelm me too. I also started noticing a pattern in the things me and my boyfriend were fighting about. It was generally about my clinginess and not letting my boyfriend have his peace being alone. I know I am an asshole for it, but I am working on it and I do believe I've come a pretty far way.

 Anyway, being clingy always went hand in hand with me not wanting to be alone. I have incredible difficulty being alone and doing something on my own. That might also have something to do with the fact that I was alone for many years. Being in a foreign country barely speaking the language, really does something to you. I would try to do something I used to enjoy before but I can't find the spark or the interest. I am honestly not even interested in anything. I scroll through my steam library looking for games I might want to play (I have many games i just bought and never played). I would find myself sitting in my room, staring at the screen of my pc, thinking about all of the possible things I could do, but not doing any of them because of just how little to no motivation I have. 

 So my questions are.. what do you people do when you are alone and have to spend time with yourself somehow? Do you have a way to push yourself in the right direction? What are your experiences so far with doing therapy and does it help you? I am also curious about more short term solutions to the motivation problem. I know discipline plays a huge role here, but discipline is also something I am heavily missing since I was basically raising myself in my teeny years. Do you have any tips I could give to the people around me to help me through my journey?

Now I didn't write down my entire life resume. There is more: from having no structure in my life to being a total train wreck at my current job, but those issues are stuff I know what to do about, just waiting for the right time.. So I focused on the things I am really struggling with finding a solution for, which is also why it's the main thing I want to talk about here.

1jfxpe1,1742499977.0,"Am I depressed? Where do I even begin? I feel like the struggles that I am dealing with are nowhere close to some people and I feel bad about myself because I shouldn't be struggling in the first place. I would say I'm a pretty average guy, I'm 21, I got into a comp sci program at a decent uni in Canada, im now in 3rd year, I'm fortunate to have a car and tuition paid for by my parents. I've been set up for success in every conceivable way and yet I can't seem to stop hating myself for various reasons. 

To start off on the social aspect, I absolutely hate introductions, talking with new people, or being the center of attention. I don't really like networking events and that's not a good thing considering I'm in a coop program where I need to get a job to maintain coop. I think I've always been like this and I can even remember as a kid I would always hide behind others in situations where I was uncomfortable. I am very open and talkative to the few close friends I made throughout elementary and highschool, but toss me In a room with a new person and I'll be bumbling over my words and I won't even be able to make eye contact. Even simple things like not being the first person into a restaurant to ask for a table, or just the other day I had dropped my debit card in a store and I was to afraid to even just go to the counter and ask ""hey have you guys happened to see a dropped debit card around here?"". I was so nervous and I just kept making excuses to my friends like ""oh I'll just get a new one and deactivate the old one, no big deal"" trying to justify every reason why it wasn't a big deal and I didn't need to go up and ask. One of my friends ended up doing it and low and behold they did have the card, and I felt so embarrassed that I couldn't even have the courage to ask a simple question because ""I felt too nervous"". 

I think this social anxiety has lead to me to not really making any super close new friends in uni, aside from some acquaintances from classes and a singular friend outside of my degree. I pretty much go to classes, occasionally talk with friends and go home. I know the school has events that I might enjoy like intramurals, or club activities such as the gaming club. But I never push myself to go because the thought of going to some random building with a bunch of random people for the first time is petrifying to me. It's like I'm incapable of putting myself out there because of this overwhelming fear of embarrassment. This has lead to me never having had a girlfriend or even gone on a date before, not that I don't want to but because I literally don't have the slightest concept of how to even get myself into a position where I could even just talk to a girl. It was also the reason I skipped high school prom, I had no one to go with, I was too shy/ fear of embarrassment to even ask anyone since I felt like I didn't know any girls well enough so I just skipped it.

These things have lead to this overwhelming sense of loneliness and disappointment in my life because I see how my friends are improving, creating meaningful connections and going towards thier goals both relationship wise but also professionally and academically. But I instead have fallen so hard into the habit of self isolation to get away from the anxiety and fear of embarrassment, compounded by the poor choice to numb myself with substances like alcohol/weed has lead to a stagnation in my life. I sit around most days just mindlessly scrolling, putting off work, sitting on my computer waiting for any of my friends to join on discord to do anything, all time that could be spent productively, but then I'd have to feel stress, and anxiety and frustration and I start to spiral into all the terrible thoughts again.

 I feel no motivation to do anything, even the things I enjoyed like gaming with friends i can only get an hour or so in on 2 different games and playing anything new feels like a chore since it might be frustrating or difficult to learn. Even trying to sit down and focus on schoolwork feels near impossible, i just feel like i dont understand things and rather than pushing through the brainfog to try and build my knowledge and understand the work, i put myself down and give up instead, leading me to heavily rely on searching online for support or answers or just trying to get AI to explain the work since I'm too tired and demotivated  to read/work on it myself, again not a good decision for a cs degree, but thats a different issue. I guess what's happened is that ive tried so hard to get rid of the situations that make me nervous, anxious, stressed, embarrassed or frustrated. And I've tried to remove them as far away from my life as possible and that has manifested into me becoming this shell of a person. I've stagnated and I feel like im pushing forwards to nowhere, with no goal in sight, and I'm just living my life day to night till I can finally fall asleep again as a temporary escape from all of these feelings that constantly torment me.

I don't feel confident in my academics, im just doing average at best (73%), I feel like I've lost the spark for learning/coding, and i see all these external events that people are doing, and the constant stream of new things that ill need to learn in this industry to even have a hope of being relevant, and it just makes me want to breakdown since the small bit of effort today is meaningless against the prodigies that actually have a genuine passion for the discipline that i seem to have lost. I'm not confident in my social skills and I definitely feel super lonely and pretty lost since I don't really have an end goal for where I want to be once I'm done school, and I tend to spiral into such negative thoughts when I even think of trying to fix myself ""it's too late"" or ""I'm already so far behind I should just quit"" get to me everytime, and I find even if I do sit down to try and push myself it takes all of 10 minutes for me to get frustrated by the mildest inconvenience and quit since I feel like I don't understand it and I'm too far behind to learn it again. I feel like trying to study is hitting a brick wall where I either just can't grasp what I'm trying to learn and it feels like I have the worst brainfog ever and I can never come to the solutions on my own.

Ive been in counselling to try and work on my thoughts and ive learned about cbt, but it just feels like im gaslighting myself from the truth of my situation that i had everything set and ive fucked my life up because of my own laziness and imcompetence. Even yesterday I got a coop interview offer and my first thought wasn't ""oh great a chance to prove myself"" it was ""I'm not qualified, why did they even pick me, im dreading meeting for this call, and I want to be done as quick as possible"". 

TLDR: I feel like a loser since I'm super anxious socially, I don't have any goals in life, and I just don't really feel motivated/happy in general most days. Definitely seems like depression or maybe I'm just a lazy person that hates putting in effort.

So my question is, is this depression? I've had these feelings for years but never felt spurred to really get any sort of diagnosis or medication to help, but I feel like if I stick to this current lifestyle I dint see it going anywhere except down. And I don't really know what else to do to fix myself, I love having these grandiose checklists and plans, but I never have the motivation to follow through when it really counts, during the present. I always put things off and I'm anxious and not very confident but I'm so so tired and I really want to change that.

The feelings of hopelessness and despair were overwhelming, and I felt as though I was drowning in a sea of emotions that I couldn't control. Recognizing that I needed help, I reached out for professional support and began attending therapy sessions, which became a crucial part of my journey toward healing. During this time, I also started incorporating regular exercise into my routine, finding solace in activities like walking and yoga, which helped to clear my mind and lift my spirits. Additionally, I began taking medications, including Zoloft, which my doctor prescribed to help me manage my symptoms.

Initially, I noticed a marked improvement—my mood began to lift, and I felt a sense of relief that I hadn’t experienced in months. However, just as I thought I was gaining ground, I was hit with a different challenge: crippling anxiety that felt even more intense than the depression I had fought so hard to overcome. This anxiety manifested itself through racing thoughts, a never-ending sense of worry, and physical symptoms like a racing heart and difficulty sleeping.

To regain some semblance of control over my life, I made a conscious decision to spend more time in nature, allowing the fresh air and sunshine to refresh my spirit. I found that being outdoors provided a much-needed escape, and I began to feel more connected to the world around me. Additionally, I focused on being productive with small goals, which helped me build confidence over time. One of the most significant changes I made was deleting most of my social media apps; I carefully curated my accounts to keep only two that I deemed essential for staying connected with loved ones. This digital detox proved to be quite liberating, as it reduced the constant influx of information and pressure to present myself a certain way.

Despite these positive changes, the journey feels like an endless battle. There are still days when the weight of my emotions feels heavy, but I am determined to push through. I want to conquer these feelings of anxiety and depression, rediscover my sense of self, and ultimately reclaim my well-being for both myself and my family. The path may be difficult, but I am committed to taking it one step at a time.",1,0,0,"depression . helps depression ? birth son , found grappling severe case postpartum depression took completely surprise . feelings hopelessness despair overwhelming , felt though drowning sea emotions could control . recognizing needed help , reached professional support began attending therapy sessions , became crucial part journey toward healing . time , also started incorporating regular exercise routine , finding solace activities like walking yoga , helped clear mind lift spirits . additionally , began taking medications , including zoloft , doctor prescribed help manage symptoms . initially , noticed marked improvementmy mood began lift , felt sense relief experienced months . however , thought gaining ground , hit different challenge crippling anxiety felt even intense depression fought hard overcome . anxiety manifested racing thoughts , neverending sense worry , physical symptoms like racing heart difficulty sleeping . regain semblance control life , made conscious decision spend time nature , allowing fresh air sunshine refresh spirit . found outdoors provided muchneeded escape , began feel connected world around . additionally , focused productive small goals , helped build confidence time . one significant changes made deleting social media apps carefully curated accounts keep two deemed essential staying connected loved ones . digital detox proved quite liberating , reduced constant influx information pressure present certain way . despite positive changes , journey feels like endless battle . still days weight emotions feels heavy , determined push . want conquer feelings anxiety depression , rediscover sense self , ultimately reclaim wellbeing family . path may difficult , committed taking one step time ."
1jfvd0s,1742494141.0,"Do you ever feel like everyone else who says they're depressed are just lying because they don't seem to function the way you do? To clarify, I am not saying this is the truth. Depression is something everyone deals with differently. This is just my own insecurities. I guess this is just sort of a vent and I'm wondering if anyone here can relate.

I have no special skills. Nothing that I can say I'm good at. Nothing I can really call my own or anything that is unique to me. Whenever I see other people talk about how they're depressed, but I see that they're good at literally anything, like they have good fashion sense, or their makeup is on point, or they're super good at art or music or anything, it sends me into a bit of a spiral.

I always constantly feel like I am being held back by myself. I feel so depressed I physically can't bring myself to do the types of things I see others accomplish. I know this doesn't mean these people aren't depressed, but I can't help the insecurity I feel when I compare. I always feel so useless. I'm not good for anything. Even these random strangers who apparently have it worse than I do can find the effort to look like this, or focus on their hobby, or just LITERALLY DO ANYTHING.

Can anyone here relate?? I just can't stand myself.

I keep thinking ""if I had a good family I would be doing so much better"" 
Thanks to them I lived through physical abuse, emotional abuse and getting sexualized by my parent and also discrimination from society. 
I couldn't talk to them when I needed help and to this day I was ""better when I was young"" bc I was more silent and hid away.

1jft428,1742488581.0,"I'm really at a loss right now Idk, tw: self harm, attempted suicide, idk, this subreddit is full of people who think the same but idk if I have to warn, sorry.

I slit my arm open not to long ago, I've cut myself but this was wide and deep and didn't stop bleeding until they sewed it up. My mother and sister were with me, but all I did was feel bad they had to see something like that, I regret getting them put of my own fear of dying (I also know seeing me dead would be a lot worse.)

They act like they care but the suicide prevention or whatever name they called the plan was to put guns away, knives, meds, etc. Because I thought of all those methods but they put the knives in our house away, then the knives in my mother's camper (where I was staying) stayed out and then a couple days later she informs me where the handgun is located (and the ammo) and I know this is probably just a slip up but then I find the whole box of medicine bottles is just stuffed into the bathroom cabinet where everyone gets their towels. Idk, I thought maybe they'd take it more seriously than before because this was an action not just words, but I'm not really sure they even think I'll do it.

It's all I've been thinking about, though. I feel like I don't want to die but I also feel like if I leave to get help (I kind of want it, I'm not sure) everyone will realize how easy it is to live without me and just not let me stay here anymore if I goget help. 

I'm 21, I don't have a job at the moment, I can hardly keep my own space clean (not that I have a room, I sleep on the couch), I can't function and the psychiatrist I saw just said to keep on my Adderall, even though that has not helped my depression, anxiety, and OCD like they say it will. I don't have insurance to cover anything either, so even if I want an inpatient stay for a couple days so they can give me something I can't really afford it (I know they will accept no matter what but they can't keep you there forever.) 

They already really dislike me, I wish they didn't and I do try to change I just feel like if I'm still so depressed I can't keep up with the happy, easy-going attitude they want from me. I know they struggle too, so I understand, I just don't understand why they get to have moments of anger at me but I can't express any when they get on me or if I'm really struggling, I know it's no excuse but I'm not screaming at them, I try to avoid them as much as possible yet every interaction we have ends up with them upset with me so I just leave, sometimes I can change the mood but I don't think they care.

I've tried the things the people at the ER told me to do instead of cutting (snap a rubber band or hold ice if the music or hanging out with my dog doesn't work, I legit have no other hobbies.) But I've resorted to using a razor I found I had stashed away again, I even hit myself with the ice (as embarrassing as it is to hit ones self, people don't take that very seriously, so idk I just find it super embarrassing) but it didn't help me enough. I'm too scared to cut like I did before (I know it's a good thing) but I want so badly to hurt myself irreversibly, so there's no time to run to anyone and even if they found me, they'd never get anywhere quick enough, but I'm still scared of dying, I'm scared I'll regret it the moment it happens just like before but as stated, there'd be no time for help at all.

I'm just at a loss for everything, my life is going nowhere and I feel like there's no solving it since I'm the person I am.

1jfo2vl,1742474780.0,"Stuck I have a feeling this isn't the first time I make a post like this online, anonymously, but I'm feeling particularly hopeless today, and I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

I'm so tired. I'm not at a risk of unaliving myself, not today. Perhaps those days are over for me. But beyond that, it hasn't gotten any better. People said it'd get better, always, they promised, and perhaps objectively it has. I do have a job, a roof over my head, and a couple of friends. But in my mind it hasn't gotten better. I wake up with the same feeling of dread I have every day in the past twenty years, live with the same anxiety that I've experienced since I was a teenager, have to deal with the same mood swings and despair I have fought with ever since I remember. I've tried therapy and meds, and those brought other issues with them. Healthcare in the UK is in shambles, so now I keep getting ""have you tried meditating"" and ""eat better"" as if even reheating a ready made meal isn't an ordeal sometimes I don't have the strength for. When my father died they offered me *six phone sessions* to heal from a lifetime of a complicated relationship and an early death. Damn, thanks.

I don't have the money for private doctors. And that's another thing, I'm always worried about money. Everything's gotten so expensive, every second of every day costs so much money, now money is also all I think about whenever it's not my depression or anxiety. Guess what? It makes it worse. Everything about this life makes a condition (or conditions) I've always lived with, worse. I used to have a much higher paying job, and my mind just couldn't cope with it, so I had to leave shortly after surviving an attempt. I thought the big city was expensive, so I moved to a smaller one, and now I am still broke anyways because the salary is lower, and also have no friends or family nearby, so I've lost all my support system. I seem unable to make new friends, and because I moved north to be able to afford life better, my seasonal depression got so bad I genuinely wasn't sure I could make it through the winter.

Every time I try to make my life better, it gets worse. I know something has to change, but I see no alternatives that are *better*. No option I can come up with, no changes I see myself able to make, that will improve things. And even then, I would have to deal with it alone, and that seems impossible at the moment. So instead I remain still, dreading every day of my life, miserable, hoping that one day I will have the strength, the mental capacity to do something to change it again, and that this time, miraculously, after years and years of failing, I'll get it right.

I have had many different themes but pedophilia ocd is the worst. I can't really even tell difference  anymore, is it groinal or arousal. For context I have never viewed anything illegal or fantasized about children, I don't want to think children like that, it's gross. I used to work at childcare without problem when I was younger. But now I don't even want to see children because it makes me anxious and feel like a creep. My main concern is that I have to obsessively think of children naked to see how I would feel.

I can't live like this, I don't want to worry about this kind of stuff. I want to be normal. My therapist says it's only ocd but it doesn't feel like it. I feel like I can't ever have normal relationship because if they knew about my concerns they would view me as a threat or a monster. I have many friends I have talked about this, they all say I'm not a monster. But it isnt enough. I don't see point in future anymore. I can't be cured from ocd, I might even be pedophile.

1jfsyme,1742488194.0,"My life is over at 29. I can't make any decisions and my life is falling apart - its all sucks I moved out of home as a troubled anxious and depressed person was i was 18, I had no plan, ended up going to study for a few years before dropping out.

I ended up bouncing around places to live between rentals that i took on low income living alone and being in disastrous relationships with other girls with mental health issues living with them before finally about 5 years ago deciding i was going to be single due to the fact i was coping so poorly.

I had a habbit of drinking copious amounts on the evenings and weekends , smoking weed in excessive amounts just basically numbing myself out and isolating myself

i somehow managed to hold onto a full time job locally in this time but became extremely depressed around about covid during the isolation period and everything fell appart

I ended up racking up some serious debt on weed and fast food, with my single income its taken me until now (2025, so 5 years) to pay it all down

in this time i managed to hold on to few good friends who I dont see as much now as they're getting their life together , married, children , buying houses holidays living a somewhat functional happy lives.

I'm now 29 years old, single, living alone, at suqare 1 with my finances, no car, no plan for the future. I live in a dingy little rental appartment with my cat and I wake up every day with crippling panick attacks and anxiety.

Somehow Im able to just push myself into work each day as a cope and keep distracted but deep down im completley falling appart.

all day long i have these horrible distrubing thoughts about myself, my life, the choices ive made and although ive put serious effort into chasing diagnosis with the health services for my mental disfunction, (on a long waiting list for therapy and being privatley checked for AdhD) i realise ive made a complete disaster out of my life.

I am not able to function properly or cope with making desicions about the future, im livingg in half self imposed isolation, i feel so incredibly miserable and hopeless that theres nothing i can really think about that gives me any kind of desire to want to be here .

Instead I operate on fear, conflictions, i feel i want to work on myself, progress my career, find a relationship , find some happiness but it all just feels futile when i just think it through. Even if I could muster the courage to decide its what i want to do i feel like a depressed, worthless bag of crap that nobody would want to be with.

i've tried in the past to be better, sleeping better, eating better doing all the so called right things, but no matter how healthy i get to on a physical level, i feel like i hate being alive, i hate the pressure, the desicions making .

I think to myself my time is ticking here in life, if I don't settle down and find love soon ill miss the boat, and maybe never have children of my own or real love in my life. Ill be as isolated as I am now but older with more mental issues and potentially physical issues too.

It scares me because i am utterly at rock bottom mentally right now and in essesnce my life is as easy as it will ever be and im the healthiest ill ever be - its all down hill from here right?

So I've pretty much given up. for the sake of my family i keep it bottled up. they know im not doing well, but they don't know how much i wish i would never wake up. I feel like whatever mental condition i have had since teenager years thats made me so negative and depressed and then my own terrible choices and coping has created a complete unrepairable mess.

Or at least by the time i get enough therapy and work through my avoidant and negative emotions towards life it will be too late to build anything worthwhile and ill regret.

I'm in a awful state, and over the last 5 years ive started falling appart. I look terrible, i sound terrible, i can't sleep, my appartment is an absolute disaster site of half broken half mess . I've stopped caring about myself and life as i feel all roads and paths forward are either impossible or so complicated with not knowing if i can even hanlde it.

I didn't even want to write this post to be honest but im desperate. I can't even sit still or have distractions from this for longer than 5 mins, its there like friggin black hole of pointlessness and the few people in my life who really want to help me just cant understand my out look.

bottom line i cant cope, ive given up, i cant convince myself that life is worth living anymore. I hate the idea that life is just 9-5 work thats not even gaurnteed, you could become unemployed and homeless at any point even thru no point of your own, its not like the right person is going to come knocking on my door and save me from this lonliness. even if i met someone who i really really liked enough to say this is all worth it, they would just be completley turned off by the state im in.

I wish i had the motivation to change but i dont want to play this game off life anymore but im a coward who would never be able to log myself off this earth. So im trapped here in misery. forced to keep going every day, pretending to be happy for people arround me and i can barely do that any more.

i try and set goals like now im out of debt maybe i can try save for a house or something as a motivation so at least if i somehow get better from this mental hell i will have at least something to help but then again whats the point. if i die alone and childless it will just be inherited straight to the government

and ive thought about just spending any money i do make on just experiences, but theres no holiday i want to go on, no thing i want to buy, nl place i want to go. I just want to go back to the clouds to the peace. I'm not cut out for this life. I'm just tortured by these conflicting unresolvable thoughts.

I know for sure people have a worse life than me out there and it just makes me feel even guiltier.

so here i am at age 29. Single, alone, in a mental prison. Not lookig after my basic needs anymore bbecause im so done.

Even if i was to roll a dice and say im fake it, im just take of my self properly, present myself, fix my house, get a new job a car start a family etc etc and so on or even jack everything in and go travelling and just live in the moment it doesnt make any difference to me, ive done handfulls of both of those things before and it never made me happy or fulfilled or helped in any way. I just feel permanently anxious depressed and negative towards what life actually is. I mean its litterly no escape from the cycle you have to get up every day, find stuff to do, balance emotions, work 9-5 cook clean eat sleep stay social save money navgiate terrible people etc and at any moment disaster could strike anyway and wipe it all away??? whats the point??? how could I possibly convince a hypothetical child of mine that life is worth living when i cant even find a damn reason to smile.

so yeah. i go about my fake miserable existence, smiling at strangers, like a parrot i pretend to have social skills, i laugh with others but its all a massive front to avoid being fired or institutionalised.

27, no friends, never had a girlfriend or sex. Incredibly lonely. Incredibly depressed. Done nearly every treatment under the sun, but nothing helps. I’m worried my life will never get better.

The thing that concerns me the most, obviously, is my complete lack of romantic and sexual experience. I feel like I’ve missed out on something fundamental, and every year that passes makes it harder to imagine things changing. The other day I saw a 15 year old kid grope his girlfriend’s breasts and as I’ve never touched a woman’s breast It made me want to kill myself. I had to call a crisis hotline. Every year the pain gets worse. I am terrified my only experience with love will be unrequited love. I feel like i have so much love to offer but the women I want are never interested. 

I work part time, my depression makes it hard to do more. Thankfully my family is well off enough it isn’t an issue. I go to the gym, been the last three days in a row which I’m proud of. I am starting to volunteer at an animal shelter. Hopefully I meet someone there but I doubt it.

The last few days I have been more hopeful that things will get better but part of me still thinks that it won’t and I am destined to be miserable and alone my entire life. I feel like the road I’m on will lead to suicide no matter what I do.

I want to hear your opinion on what is going on in my life.

I send you love and strength and I appreciate any effort in helping me.

Tl;dr: my friends, family and boyfriend are deserting me after I have been placed in a clinic after a S* attempt. What can I do?

I have been struggling with major depression now since October.
I am naturally a person full of energy, a lot of friends, a boyfriend, a job etc.

A certain point everything shattered, and I started feeling very depressed, to the point I could not leave my place.

My friends have been there every now and then to keep me some company, and my boyfriend did what he could to help me.

However my depression has been worse and worse also due to a very bad reaction to Lexapro and I have been very poorly followed by mental health institutions here (NL).

After I have been suffering so much, one morning I just decided I had enough of being bed ridden and I got some benzos.
My boyfriend found me and I am now since 2 weeks in a psychiatric clinic.

The first days my friends visited me but now they all disappeared saying that “the situation was creating too much anxiety”.

My boyfriend clearly said that he cannot give me the support I want as he cannot be there 24/7 and when I was doing bad on Lexapro it was impossible for me even to shower.

So… I am alone! I don’t know if I can do this alone. My family (italian) is also not an option as they said “depression is a tiktoc trend”.

1jfgjwl,1742443645.0,"Longest I've gone without falling back into a depressive state. It's a lifelong war It's been a few months since I've felt this much hatred for myself. I recently fell sick again and I just cant help but hate living like this. Everyday I have to endure my family, my insecurities and my overall self-loathing. I'm turning 18 this year and it has only made me feel like I've lost my years to depression and anxiety. I'm a high school dropout with no job or skills, I have only one thing that I could possible pursue as a career and I used to love doing it, but I'm even losing interest in that. I stopped visiting the psychiatrist and stopped medication because I felt like it did nothing but exhaust me and make me feel less. Now all I do is rot in bed and wish i had a better life.

I was genuinely doing great for the past few months, but my lack of progress in fixing myself up like trying to put myself together and go out more often is devastating to me. I'm filled with jealousy and rage when I see people, especially girls my age doing great and being so put-together. Everything just felt like I was putting up a front for others subconsciously, but I genuinely felt happy for awhile. I guess my emotions hit me like a train today, and all I can really do is write about it and journal it.

I've vowed to stop putting this energy out into the world and into other people's lives because, at then end of the day, it's not anyone else's responsibility but mine to take care of myself. I just don't know why I relapsed so suddenly today, I don't self-harm or anything, my own mind hurts enough. 

It fills me with so much rage knowing that I'll never be able to truly live without depression, which makes me want to end things here and now. That temporary pain for me and my loved ones would be less than the amount of pain I'd probably bring them if I continued living. Feeling like an absolute burden to everyone. Falling sick every month, can't find a job for the life of me, can't even finish the extra school my parents are paying for (I chose to take a private course to do nails) I am just losing myself. All that on top of my struggle with religion. I truly want to do better, but knowing that I will never fully fulfil the goals I set for myself is what hurts me the most. Knowing that I'll always be fighting this war with depression throughout the rest of my life while I figure out adulthood as well, it all seems so daunting. I'm accustomed to failure at this point, so I don't even bother to pursue the things I love when I know I'll make mistakes or eventually fail.

1jfnvfg,1742474099.0,"My episode of severe depression so far (last 4 months) My episode started 4 months ago with severe anxiety and bad mood all at once, at the same time my OCD spiked up dramatically. There weren't any real reasons for it, it just happened after my mood being up and down few months before (also for no apparent reason). In december I was severely panicked and went on medical leave (which I'm still on), I was already on high dose of SSRIs but we added yet another SSRI at that time and within about 6 weeks or so I started feeling less panicked/anxious but still depressed and with OCD, I was completely unfunctional, couldn't live on my own and moved back with my parents. At the end of january I even went into a mental hospital program for a week but decided to quit.

When I came back in a week I started feeling like 40-50% better and felt like I can try to go to my apartment again. Within a day there things shifted back to how they were and I had to come back home, from then depression was fluctuating somewhat but it wasn't really improving much. Hasn't returned to that feeling of being more capable again.

Because my depression was basically feeling incapable and overwhelmed by everything, not doing anything I used to enjoy and with no motivation we decided to add bupropion. I'm on it for total of 5.5 weeks now, last 3.5 on 300XL. Sadly I haven't experienced much positives from it yet and hopefully it's yet to come. In last days I also added supplements and I will do my best to start exercising again. Right now I still feel just unfunctional and incapable of doing anything (work, hobbies, taking care of myself without neglect, socializing...)

This is the worst depressive episode I experienced since being 12, and I'm 26 now, my last longer lasting episode was when I was 21 but it went away in 2 months and I wasn't this unfunctional. I'm hoping things turn around soon so that I can start my life back up and return to work.

8. Why do I always have a facade on around EVERYONE/ why don’t I ever let anyone know how I actually act/feel? 

9. Why do I cut myself- is it for my pleasure or just a silent way to show people I’m not okay? 

10. Why do I often wish something horrible would happen to me, so I would get more attention? 

11. Why have I stopped looking forward to things I used to love- nothing satisfies me anymore? 

12. Why when I feel any emotion it’s so strong- when I’m sad I fantasize about killing myself. When I’m happy I don’t feel real? 

13. Why is every time I’m happy for even just one day it’s followed by feeling awful like I don’t want to do anything for weeks on end? 

14. Why do I often have thoughts of harming myself, and others around me in detail? 

15. Why do I lose my motivation so much to the point it’s hard to wake up in the mornings without wishing I was dead? 

16. Why do I wish that I wasn’t alive- I’m not suicidal I just think it would be better if I wasn’t born in the first place? ( ew that was such a cliche).

Today I almost finished writing a last note but I stopped myself I thought this was normal because of hormones and it might be but I had a lot of symptoms from this article (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/teen-depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20350985) 
I still think I’m overreacting because I have never been bullied before except a bit by my family.

It’s a struggle to even wake up and get ready and I stopped liking to go out and just stay and scroll on my phone. I stopped enjoying hanging out, watching movies and being with my family. I’m really scared I cry for no reason many times I just want this to end what did I do to deserve this I used to have suicidal really bad ones every night around 4 years ago and it slowly came back. What affected me the most was losing my spark between my friends from last year and one friend leaving me without a reason and having her in my class. My friends making fun on me for having no new friends it hurts I just hate this. I just feel so worthless my parents are moving schools next year as I don’t have much friends this year but what if I can’t make any next year. I hate everything about myself the way I look the way I started have executive hair loss. I hate the stupid decisions I made last year. I hate I can’t make my mom proud.

He’s a very kind person. When his depression kicks in, his go-to coping mechanism is withdrawal and isolation. Most of his energy seems to be spent on maintaining a stable work life. I’ve come to accept that he is emotionally unavailable. I don’t expect him to commit to a relationship with me. 

I have BPD which I can mask for the most part. But whenever I’m seeing someone, I’m always dreadfully suspicious that they don’t actually like me. 

Recently, he cancelled a date on me at the very last minute, saying that he feels completely drained. We were supposed to meet after work (our offices are close to each other), so at least it’s not as if I went out of my way to see him. I told him that it’s okay, and that I’m there for him. Deep inside, though, I am disappointed. 

He once told me that my energy gives him joy, and that his life is better with me. If that was true, then wouldn’t he want to see me even while he’s down?

I wanted to kill myself soo many times but i was so useless that I didn’t even have the balls to go through with it. 
In all this, i stuck with fashion as some sort of therapy, i started dressing up nice taking pictures and putting myself out there on social media in the fashion space.

1jey3jx,1742394030.0,"An emotional dump from a very private man This is my first ever Reddit post, but feeling like I need to put this out there. I’m a 35 year old male, I have a great job, a solid career and good health. About 5 years ago my fiancé of 8 years broke up with me, there was no foul play, she found herself in her own midlife/career crisis and needed to spend time alone to figure her own shit out. It was mostly amicable with the exception of some tough conversations. We had to sell our home that we had purchased only 3 years prior, all of which took place spring 2020 as the entire world was shutting down. At the same time as dealing with a break up, selling a home and moving, I was forced into isolation and was working 60hour weeks in the medical field. 

The first 6 months were mostly okay, I was focused a lot on eating right and working out. I felt good about seeing progress, and I had made a good chunk of cash from the sale of the home. My plan was to take a couple of years to settle into a new life, then perhaps get out into the dating scene. That’s not what happened. 5 months after selling the home and moving out, I made the mistake of curiously setting up a tinder “just to see what it’s all about”. I was isolated and lonely, and also curious about dating. I matched with several people, chatted with a couple, and went out to meet one for drinks. The first date was a blast, tons of fun and an instant connection. I knew it was too soon, and I knew it wasn’t healthy, but it was fun and exciting so I leaned in. One date turned to many more, which then turned into a relationship, and in less than two years from my break up I was moving in with this person. I thought I had hit the jackpot, I had found such a great person so easily and quickly. Well, I was wrong.

Shortly after moving in I discovered this person 
had been sleeping around behind my back, and hiding a cocaine and crystal meth habit the whole time. I literally found the stash multiple times. When confronted I got one sob story after another and a promise to stop, mixed in with a ton of gaslighting and angry reactions including physical aggression. Needless to say, after living there for a year and wishfully hoping it would get better, it didn’t, and I was moving out again in less than a year. I had also blown all my savings when with this person, which was totally ny responsibility, but found my self in a position of living paycheck to paycheck. 

So here I go again, moving into a new apartment, starting over again and dealing with a highly toxic break up. I was always a casual week smoker, but weed became my crutch, I was smoking every day, sometimes before and after work. I had for the first time in my life major episodes of depression and anxiety, intermittent moments of panic, and a total loss of self control. I stopped working out, gained weight and was eating trash food constantly. I started isolating from friends and family, and all I wanted was to be home alone with weed and food. 

Here I am, two years later, and still doing the same thing. I feel so stuck, I’ve tried so many times to pull myself together, every Monday I promise myself a fresh start but the urge to smoke is so hard to resist, and I still have tons of anxiety about being in debt, and days of feeling like the whole thing is pointless. I had suicidal thoughts for the first time in my life which has been terrifying, but I know I will never do that, because I can’t stand the thought of how much pain it would cause others. I beat myself up for getting into this position, and I’m totally aware that I am lucky in many ways, good health, great friends/family, good career, a home to live in etc. 

Anyway, apologies for the novel, it’s been a busy five years for me. Literally nobody knows my struggle, I mask it all and make sure nobody sees how bad things are. I have always been an incredibly private person emotionally, hence the emotional dump here. I am hanging onto hope that one day soon I’ll find the strength and discipline to get my shit together. If you took a minute to read this, thank you.

1jfhyxm,1742449124.0,"I feel confused and need to vent Hi, I have dealt with depression for many years. Things have gone better over the years but from time to time I would start to feel depressed again. 

I started psychological therapy at 18, at 20 I got referred to a psychiatrist and started antidepressants and and anxiolytics. I got diagnosed with bpd although, I have never done risky or impulsive things, I did have mood swings that would go from normal to wanting to die to normal again in short periods of time and had a deep fear of abandonment and attached deeply to people even when they hurt me. I had to change psychiatrist because he got too expensive but he referred me to another. I got off anxiolytics (apparently they are not very good for people with bpd) and after some months I was off antidepressants too, although I had to come back for a little while due to some personal stuff. After a year I “graduated”  therapy (it focused more on emotional regulation) and got referred to group therapy because I wanted to get better at socializing. I used to love talking to people, and soacializing, but now I am too scared to. I have gone through some shitty stuff, abuse, betrayal, harassment and have cut off a lot of people I cared for deeply because of them not caring for how I was treated or keeping in contact with the people harassing me. It was hard and it still hurts after some years.  

I have felt better than before, I now know how to be alone and deal with my things and ask for help sometimes. But I don’t really like myself very much, I am very awkward and I fear people don’t find me interesting enough. I have tried to change but I lack the confidence to do so. I do have very good friends but they are all very independent so I don’t hang regularly with them and feel alone most of my time, we don’t chat very often either. I want to do it more but I am scared of being a burden or being seen as pathetic, and I also respect their time and the attention they can give me and well, they do like to be alone a lot. I don’t know where to meet more people, I used to have a lot more initiative and talked to people more (even when scared) but everything started building up and now it’s so hard to speak with people. I keep them at arms length, and don’t go out too much, when I do it is very hard and extremely scary, I feel I am in so much danger. I used to have a lot of friends but we grew apart and I don’t feel like I belong anymore, but I know that’s just life. I know I can make friends or I used to be able to. it makes me feel sad that I have come to this. I never imagined still being in this stage in my life after so many years of actively trying. I have always struggled to really connect with people but more from my end, for example, people would tell me we have been friends for a year but I would feel that we either were not friends or have been for less time, but not because I didn’t like them but because it takes a lot of time for me to really feel I am liked. I don’t know how to stop feeling like that, I keep myself from connecting. I am scared they secretly hate me, or that I make them a favor by being away. Ever since I was 14 years old I have been actively trying to be better at socializing and getting better confidence, I used to read a lot of books on how to talk to people and watched videos, but I don’t get how to feel close to people, I don’t understand relationships, I know how they should look like and how I should behave but it feels like following a recipe. 

I am so confused and sad that after ten years of actively trying to learn and 7 years of therapy I still can’t. I don’t know how to be more likable without being too tryhard. And it’s getting hard again, I am having suicidal thoughts again, I cry often and at night I have the worst anxiety, my heart pounds too much, I get dizzy, feel a pain in my chest and that’s when I want to die the most. I still feel in control though, I am in no danger, I don’t self harm nor have real intentions of following through, but I do feel a little suicidal. 

I don’t know if I am making sense, it’s late, I am tired and confused and don’t really know what I am searching for with this post. I just needed to vent. I do have friends I can talk to, but when I was very depressed I overwhelmed a friend with it, I used to ask if he was okay with me talking about it so often and he always gave me permission to do it ( I did ask if he was okay to listen every time I unpacked) but he wasn’t, and eventually it was too much for him and our friendship ruptured. It hurt a lot but I get him, I have tried to fix it and especially now that I am better but he has moved on and even though it’s sad it is okay. But due to that I am scared to talk about this things with my friends too often, I am scared I might lose them as well if they can’t draw the line for when it is too much and I cant read minds. And I have been feeling low more often. 

I want emotional connection but it’s hard for me. I want to meet new people but I don’t know where or how. I want to like myself more, i have a lot of things I value a lot and I work on myself so much. But because I don’t feel liked by others I stop liking myself. I am proud of who I am and how much effort I put into all aspects of my life. But it’s sad that I put in so much effort and attention and not be able to have satisfactory friendships. I want to change, I want to learn and grow but I just can’t understand relationships, I can’t assimilate that I am worth people’s time and affection and automatically decide to “let them be” and not to “annoy them with my presence”. Even if now I am not in danger I do feel that if this doesn’t change I will end up giving up in some years, it’s hard to enjoy things.

I feel I try so hard at life and still suck haha. I do have healthy habits, I eat well, force myself to have breakfast which I hate, force myself to exercise, play an instrument, I am learning my fifth language, I have a stable good paying job, I have great finances and have been investing for some years, I do invest in skin care and hair care, I journal, and I am going to my dream internship as well. I do all the healthy things people advise you to to have a healthy, happy, fulfilling life but it doesn’t work. Like I said, it feels like following a recipe, a set of rules but it does nothing to me. I don’t enjoy anything.

1jfhq6c,1742448138.0,"Nostalgia/depression Hey everyone. Thought I’d share this, 

I go to weekly therapy for depression, OCD, and anxiety/panic disorder along with PTSD and some phobias I need to work through. 

One thing that I have been seriously struggling with with my depression is nostalgia. I feel as though I almost missed out on some things in my child hood because of specific phobias and well everything I listed above. But also just the longing to go back in time and experience being a child again with no care in the world, when school was fun, and just doing anything I wanted really. I shared this thought with my therapist and she said “well why don’t you”. 

Immediately confused (now that I am 18) and she asked me what things I liked doing as a kid. I really said being outside and building forts in the woods, playing on play grounds and stuff like that. She then asked me what hobbies I had as a kid. Immediately I said “well I had a harmonica I loved to play”. So right then and there in my therapy session I ordered a harmonica off Amazon. 

Since this discovery I’ve done more hobbies. I’ve made slime with friends, walks in the woods, welded (don’t really know why I was using a torch as a kid but here we are), done some simple art projects (as an artist I really give myself no enjoyment any more doing art  for people because I feel it has to be perfect), and heck I even climbed the same huge tree the other day that I climbed when I was a kid!!

I know doing all this stuff doesn’t fix depression but to me it is a start. So I thought I would share incase someone is struggling with something similar. 

In the next coming weeks I am taking myself and some friends to a drive-through petting zoo!!",1,0,0,"nostalgiadepression hey everyone . thought would share , go weekly therapy depression , ocd , anxietypanic disorder along ptsd phobias need work . one thing seriously struggling depression nostalgia . feel though almost missed things child hood specific phobias well everything listed . also longing go back time experience child care world , school fun , anything wanted really . shared thought therapist said well . immediately confused 18 asked things liked kid . really said outside building forts woods , playing play grounds stuff like . asked hobbies kid . immediately said well harmonica loved play . right therapy session ordered harmonica amazon . since discovery done hobbies . made slime friends , walks woods , welded really know using torch kid , done simple art projects artist really give enjoyment art people feel perfect , heck even climbed huge tree day climbed kid ! ! know stuff fix depression start . thought would share incase someone struggling something similar . next coming weeks taking friends drivethrough petting zoo ! !"
1jfhp2k,1742448014.0,"Is he depressed, or is he just not into me? I’ve (29F) been seeing this guy (33M) on and off for a while. A few months ago, he shared that he has a long-term clinical diagnosis of a depressive disorder (did not disclose the classification) and takes SSRIs. He’s a kind person who speaks to everyone respectfully, and he also struggles with anxiety and low self esteem. His go-to coping mechanism during hard times is withdrawal and isolation. I’ve come to accept that he is not emotionally available and I don’t expect commitment from him.

I have BDP, which I have come to manage for the most part. However, every time I date someone, I’m always fearful over the possibility that they aren’t actually attracted to me.

The night before our scheduled date, he texted me saying that he’s looking forward to it. We were supposed to meet after work. Right before 5 pm, he cancelled via text, saying that he felt completely drained. I told him that it’s ok and that I’m there for him. Deep down, I feel uneasy and hurt.

In the past, he told me that my energy brings him joy and that his life is better with me. I’m not sure if I can believe these words.

1jfhgwx,1742447106.0,"Just need someone to respond Hi all,

Throwaway account.  I have literally no one to talk to so I thought this would be me feel a little better.  I’m in my early 20s and feeling the lowest I’ve ever felt.  Currently, for the past week I get up and just wait for bed time so I can turn off my lights and cry.  Before this week I hadn’t cried in idk how long, but it’s coming easy now.  

My current lull started over a girl I guess but I’ll give some back ground info.  Since 2020 I began struggling with anxiety really bad, from zero to 100 out of no where having panic attacks.  In conjunction with this new anxiety and quarantine, this enabled me to pretty much hide from everything which was probably the worst thing that could’ve happened.  Slowly Lost contact with all my friends because I stopped going out in social gatherings, no I have really no social life or anyone to talk to.  I just go to school idek why at this point, barely have any motivation to do assignments.  But about 7 months ago I started a new job, at this time I wasn’t really depressed just had bad anxiety but slowly it was getting better.  Then after a few months a new girl gets hired, Alex.  And idk why but at first sight I was in love, not actually but you know what I mean.  Huge crush on her.  Still struggling badly with social anxiety/awkwardness, so I didn’t have the courage to talk to her besides giving her a smile and saying hi while passing by or holding the door open for her.  I can talk to anyone with no anxiety, but the second I have a slight crush on you all my social skill fly out the window and I overthink everything and become incredibly awkward.  Anyways my anxiety has been getting better and I could start to feel comfortable enough to get to know her and ask her out.  Finally my anxiety was getting better and I worked up the courage to talk to her at the end of the work day.  I told someone I work with I thought she was pretty and that I was going to talk to her and they were like oh yea she is, but you know she has a boyfriend?  And dude my heart just freakin sank.  And to make it worse he also works at our work and now I see them together it just sucks, so much.

Now I can’t stop thinking about her wtfff, just ruminating on what could’ve been/what I wish would’ve been.  I’m normally not like this though.  I think it’s hitting me bc for the past 5 years I’ve struggled with anxiety to the point that i willingly let me social life die and pretty much just came to terms that this would be my life from now on.  That I wouldn’t have a gf, no wife, no kids, I just came to terms that I’d die alone and that was just the cards I was dealt, horrible way to think I know, but it made it a little easier.  I think it sucks so much because I’ve finally gotten to a point where I feel like I can begin to have a life again, I can think of having a gf, the one girl I was interested in, in years, has a bf and now I don’t even get to shoot my shot.  Idk this was so freakin demoralizing and just made me feel hopeless.  Especially bc I couldn’t even tell you the last time I found a girl pretty or was interested and she’s really cool from everything I’ve heard pick workers say about her, literally my type personified.  So now I just walk past her everyday and it’s a reminder that I can’t do anything about it.  

Idk if it’s even about her that I’m feeling so down or more so the fact that I just feel like I’m never going to experience love in addition to having zero friends.  I just go to work and do homework.  Feeling really fuckin down, no one to talk to AT ALL.  Only thing keeping me going is the new Carti album fr.  “Like Weezy” has been lifting my spirits up.  I think for the past few years I’ve had mild depression just because of the anxiety that prevented me from doing the things I wanted/used to do, but that slowly took a toll on me to the point that I’m just a shell of what I used to be.  At this point I’m rambling, this made feel a little better.  Thinking of trying meds to get rid of anxiety/depression idk also kinda embarrassed to though especially as a guy.

TLDR; anxiety has run my life for the past 5 year, lost social life due to extreme fear, finally started to get a little better and began picturing getting a gf, started crushing on a girl just to find out she has a bf the day I worked up the courage to say something to her.   Now I can’t stop thinking of her and it makes me feel like I’m never going to find love and how shit my social life is and how bad my life is in general.

It’s almost like I can see all of it again like it’s a 4K movie playing in my head. That whole night where I called and texted dozens of times because I thought she may have gotten hurt at the concert she was at since even past midnight her phone location was still there (her request to have one another’s locations), drove an hour to the venue at 2am, and found her reclined in her car with a guy she met at the show


Of course, there’s more to the story, including her turning off the emergency bypass ringtone (which was her idea to have in the first place) and texting me when I nearly pulled up to the venue that she was home safe, but those are the highlights


I still don’t know for a fact to this day whether she did cheat on me or not. I definitely think that she did, but I don’t have proof. I feel like I can’t tell a future partner “oh, I was cheated on” without definitive proof because then I’ll look bad for assigning the label of cheater without having concrete evidence, only circumstantial


But anyway, what even is trauma? I’m spiraling so hard as I write this. Whenever I get these waves of emotions, these images trapped in my head, I just feel broken. I feel traumatized? Does calling it trauma help with realizing the pain of it? Is it even significant enough to deem trauma, or am I just devaluing how significant of a word that is by feeling like I may have been? Am I just trying to give it to the worst word I can think of because it was one of the worst things anyone has done to me?

Always had a decent social life in high school, was a member of a couple clubs and my school’s golf team. I never thought of myself as “happy” but I enjoyed life I guess. everything was okay. I ended up going to a lower end college because even though I was accepted to a bunch of great schools I couldn’t end up going to any of them. Story for another time. But at this school was a girl I had met for an orientation for the school a couple months before. She was in a relationship but we still became good friends. I was in love with her. We became closer and closer as friends and were eventually best friends, I was happy to know her at all but deep down I needed more. While all of this was going on, I continued to excel in school and put myself on track to graduate a year early, which I did last May. Eventually, this girl and I did become more than friends… not long after her longterm relationship ended. It was the best year+ of my life and the only time I’ve ever been truly and genuinely happy. Lost her last July, she left me for someone else. In the meantime, my life has collapsed and I’m convinced my life is going to be a total waste.

1jf7ano,1742417062.0,"If only midas could touch himself I know the title may be vague but everything i say next will explain it. The last few years have been hell for me... everything i have put my hands on has been destroyed. It all started 6 years ago. 

I had a few friends and we were friends since childhood. They broke their friendship with me because I was talking to someone none of them approved of. That day I lost 5 of my closest friends. After that my girlfriend of 1.5 years decided to break up with me without any reason. I loved her dearly and loosing my friends and girlfriend all together took a massive toll on me. I decided this city had ntg left to offer me so I started the process to move abroad for further studies. This initially seemed like a great idea but soon I realised this was the worst mistake I could have made.

The uni I enrolled in was too much for me I couldn't keep up with my studies and was failing all my classes. Soon I was kicked out of my course and had to opt for a course I hated. All the while I was not able to land any jobs I kept looking and interviewing for 9-10 months but wasn't able to land anything. I began to feel like a complete failure who couldn't even land entry level jobs or perform well in my studies. I started to hate myself. These feelings were fueled by the fact that I wasn't able to make any new friends. I was always isolated from my group projects and meet ups any semblance of joy would be crushed when I would see the same people go out and laugh with each other. This made me hopeless by the end of my 2nd year I was suicidal and would have gone through with it if I hadn't decided to come back.

After 2.5 years of staying abroad I would return to my hometown and start rebuilding a new life from scratch. The transition was not easy because I would constantly feel like a failure who couldn't fulfill my parent's expectations and essentially wasted an enormous about of money for nothing. After starting in a new college I was able to make a few friends but as my social situation improved my personal life started to dip. My father started drinking. And he drank so much that there was never a minute where he would be sober. What followed was months of abuse, fighting, suicide attempts, visits to hospitals, lawyers, police and what not. This 3 years became unbearable for me because everytime my father would be angry he would point out how big of a disappointment I am, how other kids my age are already out building businesses and earning while i was sitting in my home wasting space and money. I started to go out less and less because I was always afraid what would happen to my mother or my grandfather if I wasn't there and my father became angry. This destroyed whatever social life I had managed to rebuild.

I did manage to find someone who supported me through everything and eventually we fell in love with each other. I had finally graduated with a bachelor's degree and i was finally beginning to feel happy for the first time in a long while. I had my plans for starting my own business, something I was really passionate for. But fate had other plans my girlfriend decided to break up with me because she has fallen out of love with me. This broke me completely. The person I loved more then myself had decided to leave me because she didn't love me anymore. I began replaying every moment of our relationship and realised if I had paid more attention to her needs and listen more carefully to whatever she was saying I could have saved it but it's no use now. I have lost her. It's been 1 month from the break up and now I am scared to do anything. Because everything I do or put efforts for eventually finds a way to unravel itself. I don't want to start a business anymore because it would mean loosing all the money my friends and family would entrust me with. I don't wanna put in any efforts to build new friendships coz they will eventually move on with their lives and I will be helpless once more. I don't want to fall in love again because it hurts so bad when the person just decides to give up on you. I don't wanna leave my bed. I just go to the gym because that's the only way I can inflict pain on myself that's acceptable in this world we live in.

I could not wake up tomorrow and no one would ever notice. I have no friends or family. If I ever talk to them I have to reach out first most of the time. That’s  if I haven’t been sent to voicemail first. 

I’m living everyday with no purpose. I grew up in an abusive household growing up then was kicked out as a teen so I’ve always looked for love in girls and friends that just used me. Im always giving and get nothing in return. I’ve given people a place to stay, loaned money, I’m the type of person if I have you have it. But I’m on the brink of homelessness and I can’t even get a call back or any help. My job is doing layoffs and they reduced my pay without notice.

I (F22) have BPD, OCD and I'm severely depressed right now. I had really traumatic childhood and I lived in foster home for while. I've been hospitalized in psych ward four times. Last time was because I planned my suicide to great detail and wrote a goodbye letter. 

I've lost every romantic relationship because I'm too unstable. I feel like I don't deserve love. That every time I do love someone, I hurt them so much and they leave me. I'm one big mistake. I'm walking red flag. I'm taking my meds, I have therapist and psychiatrist, but it isn't helping. I lost all hope for myself. I missed lot of school and I'm worried that I won't finish it, that I will never accomplish my dreams. I just feel so empty and disgusted by myself. My limbs are covered by deep scars, I hate looking at myself. I scare everyone away from me. I want to have family, kids and normal life. Maybe just a feeling like my life is worth living would be enough. 

My question is, will it get better? Is there any hope for me? Will the pain go away? Can someone like me have loving partner and family? Can I have somewhat normal life?

1jfbb2c,1742427531.0,"48F and totally unhappy Wall of text on the way…Like the title says 48yo female and I’m completely unhappy with my life. I lost my husband  of 18 years (together for 27 years total) a few years ago to a really bad car accident. He lived for nine months in the hospital and ultimately passed away due to complications from the accident the accident. I was there every day from the sun up to sundown and then some so I really felt like I was grieving in real time so when he finally passed, it didn’t hit me like a ton of bricks. I was determined to put that chapter behind me and rebuild my life because I had given so much of my life to his situation over the nine months he was in the hospital. Fast forward several months I met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off really well. He lived five hours away from me and we would take turns driving back-and-forth to see one another every weekend. We finally decided we were going take the relationship to the next level which involved us deciding that we need to be closer physically. And because I have a WFH job I made the move. I found a place that I really liked and made the move. Things were going great until they weren’t. Fast-forward and I’m sure you can figure it out-things didn’t work out. Seems like things kind got off kilter once we were able to see each other “in the wild”. I was actually OK with the break up because I got to see the real him on a near daily basis and it was evident that we would not last long term. Now I’m just stuck. I love this city and my place but I’m in here with no friends and because I WFH there’s not really an organic way for me to meet and interact with people like going to an office everyday. I’m an introvert by nature so that makes it even more difficult for me to just go out and be social. I have an adult son and he’s living his life to the fullest so I’m just here. Every day I get up, log into work, work for a few hours (I’m super caught up because I just work when I’m bored on the weekends and such) then log off my computer and then I just go lay on my bed and watch TV or doom-scroll on the Internet. I’m an admin in a Facebook group so you know I have a pretty good social media presence, but I want to interact with people in person. I’ve met other guys but they have varying degrees of baggage. The one that I really get along with has a toddler (he’s almost 50yo…sheesh) so that makes it difficult to get close because he’s either working (3-11 shift when I work 7-3 shift) or he has his son. So I don’t think that that’s going to go anywhere. I ended up taking six weeks off of work because I was just so depressed at my life. Sometimes I feel like I don’t have a right to be depressed. I’m the envy of my small circle of close friends (who live in other states so I cannot hang out with them)—I’ve got a really great paying job, want for nothing materially, pretty darn attractive by most standards, adult who are not a hanger on, I can do what I want when I want. I literally have ZERO baggage. But none of that translates into anything meaningful. And I mean make or female relationships. I’ve tried to meet ups and going to different events but being an introvert makes that so daunting. Who knew at almost 50 years old I’d be struggling with something like this…le sigh.

I no longer have the prescription to the drug I used for this method.

I had to go from doctor to doctor all my teenage and young adult years, missing out on friendships and romance. Only after my suicide attempt did someone finally get me diagnosed with these two disabilities. Only now do my parents finally ""support"" me. But I was 24 when it happened. I turned 26 this february and felt nothing but misery. I should've never turned 18. I should've never been born to begin with

I have nothing to live for and no one to live for. i started studying audio engineering but despite my passion for music and editing and post production i don't have it in me to continue. I'm a manicurist but no matter how hard I try I can't find customers or get better at my work and I'm just tired. I'm not good at anything, I don't have money. Every day when i wake up it's a chore to exist. it's a chore and a slog to just LIVE.

I want to die. I have never wanted anything more in my life than to just go to bed one night and not wake up and that's exactly what I felt when i first attempted suicide. i cannot describe the level of calm and peace and elation i felt going to bed after ingesting that medicine knowing that it's all over. I have told my father many times that I resent him for taking that away from me.

I found a new suicide method. one that takes mere minutes to kill the person and it uses extremely accessible materials. No prescriptions required. I just ordered the very things I will use to end my life and the moment they're in my possession I will do exactly that. I'll make sure it's right after my father leaves for his job when i'm not working so i can have a full 8 hour exposure. Most websites say it takes about 10-30 minutes max but I'm not risking it. By the time he's home I'll be decomposing.

It doesn't get better. none of that ""suicidal people want to LIVE not just survive"" shit is true either. Capitalists need cogs for their machines so they made up some bullshit about the ""sanctity of life"" in their shitty little religions to make people feel guilty for wanting to end their lives when in nature, many animals end their own lives and assist other animals to end their lives.

for the first time in my life I think I am depressed. went through the worst heartbreak I’ve ever experienced in november and it’s been downhill from there. I have a great life and so many things to be grateful for but I can’t find it in me to care and kind of don’t have a will to keep going. I started thinking about suicide (not planning but just ideation) a few weeks ago which is further than I’ve gone before. I started buspar for anxiety and it has helped w the racing thoughts and ruminating but my depression has seemingly been worse the last few months. I’ve never taken any antidepressants and I’m kind of nervous to start because I know they can have a lot of side effects/take time to work/withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking them etc but I was wondering if anyone here has had any luck with an anti depressant that isn’t an SSRI. for the last several months I’ve been meditating, journaling, praying, working out, talking to friends, reading helpful literature… nothing has helped. 

I have an appointment w my primary care doc to discuss options but thought I would ask my peers first. any suggestions are appreciated.

I haven’t been diagnosed with anything yet, I’ve just suspected I had maybe just mild depression or something for a while. I’m getting a therapist soon (finally) but I wanted to ask people who’ve been formally diagnosed or know a good thing or two about feeling like this.

So basically, I have enough energy to go to my classes (most of the time), just about finish my work, etc. I can also enjoy gaming or everyday activities and most of the day my mood is just neutral or bored some days. Right now, for example, I feel fine? Like not happy or positive but also not really down. Other days, I feel super low, and I don’t want to do anything and I feel completely hopeless, like a failure, like a loser. I hardly have friends because I don’t make the effort to reach out and talk, and I barely talk to them when I do. I am constantly tired, which could also be a symptom of other medical problems I have including anemia and stuff. I don’t have motivation to do any work outside what is required, I barely study for tests, I barely put effort into homework, I just sit in my dorm all day and watch my phone. 0 plans for a future, can’t imagine one and just trying to get by the days. These sad bouts only last like 3-4 days, not 2+ weeks like I’ve seen which is the norm for depression, and then I’m ‘fine’ again for another few days.

Idk if this is just the norm for me because this has been going on for 4+ years now. Every time I have a happy moment I feel invalid or like I’m faking everything. It’s built up the past few years and I just have passive (rarely active, but sometimes it almost gets there) suicidal ideation and constant urges to self harm (I have a history of it but I’ve kept myself clean a few months). Maybe I don’t have depression, but I don’t feel like this is normal and it’s driving me actually insane. I don’t know what to do.

No matter how bad the psychiatric issues of anyone in the family gets, it doesn't cross their mind to see a shrink. Your social anxiety, depressive disorders, bipolar, or schizo- disorders mean nothing to them. Those words are just constructs to them.

You are ""you"" at each step of the way. You are ""manic""? Nope! You are the one making the decisions to run off and start some stupid projects. You are depressed, motivated? Nah, you are being lazy- which kind of makes sense. What about cognitive decline due to whatever ish with your head. ""You used to be smart"", ""I don't know why you decide to be stupid"".


I used to harbor grudges against them, was planning to cut them off, but seeing how my father's sister slowly wasted away, and also watching my elder brother becoming a shell of a human everyday, I am beginning to think they do not know any better, and not them being irresponsible.

1jewu48,1742390522.0,"I’m so depressed, how do I deal with seeing my ex and his new gf everyday 
I would really appreciate your advice

I (20F) have been with this guy for a year in the first year of uni (we were exclusive). We did everything couples would do, cook together, shower together, sleep together. I did everything for him, packed him lunch and washed his clothes(I know how pathetic). 

After one year he still didn’t ask me to be his girlfriend but I loved him so I stayed, then he left me cus he wanted to be independent and alone. My mental health was so bad during that time and I got diagnosed with complex PTSD/Borderline Personality Disorder. I have abandonment issues and problems with my dad. 

I have been in long term relationships since a young age and I have never been alone for long/single. I decided to move in campus to a college to experience uni life (first year i lived off campus alone but he slept over at mine everyday so we were really close). He knew I was moving on campus for better mental health. 

But one month after he left me to be “independent” I see his location is at my accomodation and it turns out he’s seeing someone in my new college building. I see them together all the time during dinner and breakfast knowing that they slept together, or hearing their friends in the halls talk about it (he doesn’t live in my college but in another college across the road, he’s always here though). 

Seeing them really triggers my bad BPD tendencies and I start comparing myself to her a lot (I have very low self esteem) then go into a spiral. After finding out he’s seeing someone in my college it was bad, i had to start antipsychotics and go on stronger antidepressants. I just don’t know what to do with myself. I have exams and ai know I should be locking in but I can’t even do that because I’m so heartbroken and I’m in so much pain and hurt seeing them together. 


I would really appreciate your advice on how to move on, heal my heart, learn that he’s not worth it (he treated me with barely any respect and i felt like he was using me for food, sex, and like affection). I just want to learn how to be okay and love myself cus I hate myself. I’m so sad, I love him so much. I’m sorry this is so long, I’m trying to get therapy but it’s hard to.

Please help me and give me advice on how to move on, feel better, not care about him, focus on exams.",2,3,0,"depressed , deal seeing ex new gf everyday would really appreciate advice 20f guy year first year uni exclusive . everything couples would , cook together , shower together , sleep together . everything , packed lunch washed clothesi know pathetic . one year still ask girlfriend loved stayed , left cus wanted independent alone . mental health bad time got diagnosed complex ptsdborderline personality disorder . abandonment issues problems dad . long term relationships since young age never alone longsingle . decided move campus college experience uni life first year lived campus alone slept mine everyday really close . knew moving campus better mental health . one month left independent see location accomodation turns seeing someone new college building . see together time dinner breakfast knowing slept together , hearing friends halls talk live college another college across road , always though . seeing really triggers bad bpd tendencies start comparing lot low self esteem go spiral . finding seeing someone college bad , start antipsychotics go stronger antidepressants . know . exams ai know locking even heartbroken much pain hurt seeing together . would really appreciate advice move , heal heart , learn worth treated barely respect felt like using food , sex , like affection . want learn okay love cus hate . sad , love much . sorry long , trying get therapy hard . please help give advice move , feel better , care , focus exams ."

This might be a silly question but i really struggle to understand if the way ive felt in the last 5 years is a normal human experience or not
(I only refer to the last 5 years bc i only can remember them)

i can only recall 2 periods in my life where i was actually happy and enjoyed life, but the rest of the time i was extremely depressed or just felt numb

I cannot say that the times i felt numb were “bad” but i also cannot say that they were “good”, i mainly felt like everything was fine,
but something felt “missing”
i also felt emotionally detached from my relationships

i dont know if this is just the same for everyone or maybe a more serious issue. 

I question it because i feel very overwhelmed from feeling empty, but i also do not know if its an actual problem, because it feels like i just have unrealistic exceptions  from life

Certainly, I was a jealous, lying 11-year old.


I was dismissed when I tried to escape an abusive household.
Surely, I couldn't make choices for myself and a teenager can only be the cause of problems.


I was dismissed when I left home.
Of course, I must not have realised what it meant.


I was dismissed when I showed signs of depression.
Certainly, it only meant that I was finally showing my true colours. It was simply who I was.


I was dismissed by a therapist.
He fell asleep every time.


I was dismissed by another therapist.
You see, a therapist cannot do anything for you but show you the door if you start to have suicidal thoughts.


I was dismissed when I opened up about my struggles.
Surely, a platitude with no later check-in is enough of being a friend.


I was dismissed when I shared my feelings.
Obviously, I must have no idea what some people go through. People actually suffer, you know? 


I was dismissed when I shared my situation.
'Why do you care?' 'Why do you stress?'


I was dismissed through the obvious.
You see, some people end up telling you they really worried about you seeing you like *that*, but apparently they had to wait for you to get better to let you know.


I was dismissed by another therapist.
Certainly, I must not have been trying enough, do I even have discipline? Well, at least I was acknowledged for being 'indeed' fat.


I was dismissed by a psychiatrist.
The appointment never happened.


I was dismissed when reaching out for professional help.
The reality is that it took 8 months to find someone who wasn't even a good match, all the while dealing with suicidal thoughts.


I was dismissed when I needed time to process being dismissed.
You see, I was creating a bad atmosphere.


I was dismissed when I questioned things.
Who do I think I am? What do I know?


I was dismissed when I showed concern.
You see, I must have had too much time on my hands during my unemployment to imagine something was wrong. 


I was dismissed when I backed my concern with observations.
'Are you on your period?'

I was dismissed when I looked for connection.
'You don't matter because I have broken up'


I was dismissed when I offered help.
Surely, nobody ever does need help.


I was dismissed when I needed help to do something.
'Just do it!'


I have been dismissed as we all have been in some way. I was lucky to experience it very soon in relationships that should have been safe, when I still couldn't really grasp what it meant. It certainly prepared me better for what I was going to go through. But that doesn't make any of it OK, not with anyone.


Reaching out for professional help is brave, it is often what seems like a last resort. But those places are not always safe. I personally experienced only one matching safe place in therapy out of 5. This translates into a 20% chance to find a therapist that would actually be helpful. 
This is ridiculously low. A therapist being unhelpful, if not straight up bad is *not* a neutral situation. From a place of despair, any interaction has deep impacts. And professionals come with an authority that is hard to fight, especially when our state is fragile, when trying feels hopeless, when our thoughts already need energy to be fought.


I want to believe that I've been unlucky, it would mean that things are better for others, but it seems all too common a tendency for me to truly believe that. 


Mental health issues are on the rise. Maybe you've been lucky, maybe you've looked down on those with such issues, but statistically, your kids, your nephews, are next. It is alarming. 

I am sharing those snippets of my history because while I was dismissed, you are not. You are not dismissed from playing your part in our collective responsibility to create a caring society. 


It starts at our level. 


It starts with how we interpret what we see. How do we label people who don't fit our expectations? How do we react when someone's acting differently than they used to? How do we act towards someone struggling? Do we ever push people to get a sense of satisfaction?


It starts in the space between each other.
Whether with colleagues, relatives, friends, strangers, lovers.
What do we bring to that space? How do we nurture it? Is it shared equally? What can enter it, what can't, and why?


It starts with ourselves. 
Are we accepting ourselves and our flaws? Are we putting our comfort first? Are we allowing connection? Vulnerability? What and who feels safe? What and who doesn't? Why? When are we defensive? When are we betraying ourselves? How is fear guiding us? What are we blocking? What are we fleeing? Are we observing our behaviours and others'? Are we aware of our impact on others and are we taking accountability and responsibility for it? Are we truly listening? Are we acting or hoping? Are we trying, are we questioning, are we learning, are we improving? Or are we dismissing, resigning, avoiding?


Helping and receiving help are equally hard. Our efforts may not always matter, they may go unnoticed, get deflected and dismissed. But I think our collective power lies in trying, in refusing to give up, in keeping our light going and making it grow. With every smile, every eye contact, every small act of care, through every way we can show that we remember something about someone because we listened, that we recognise what someone did and contributed to, that we understand a situation someone is going through and how it does feel. It lies in every question that replaces judgment, it lies in acceptance replacing criticism. We're all flawed and we're never going to love everyone. But we don't have to make ourselves feel better at the expense of anyone, we don't have to bond through judgment, through the cultivation of feeling superior to anyone.
We can instead start to bond because we make space for each other, because we make each other feel seen, appreciated and accepted. 


I am not trying to advocate for a naive and impossible vision of interpersonal relationships. But it doesn't take that much to change a dynamic. It's inviting someone to join a group, it's calling out a bully, it's sitting with someone isolated, it's backing the voice of those who speak up, it's showing understanding for those who struggle. It's a thank you, a compliment, a 'are you okay?'.


What if we started to truly care for each other and show up? 


As James Baldwin said: everyone you're looking at is also you. But maybe you first need to see yourself fully.


A ridiculous amount my 34 years, I have dealt with mental health issues. I have gone in and out of darkness more than once and reached depths many will luckily never know. Sometimes, life hangs on not much more than a feeling of guilt, a memory of kindness or new music to discover.
We are fragile and our battles are unseen a lot of the time. 
The system is failing us and we are failing each other.
It is not to say professional help is not needed and helpful, it absolutely is. If my story is common though, it is easy to not feel that way and to give up. That's why we need to step up for each other.

We met about 5 months ago on a dating app. The first month, as we were texting, was awesome and I really started to like her. But after we went for a first date, she told me she has depression. She started to distance herself and sometimes doesn't text for days. When she feels good, we go for a date (usually to eat somewhere). When we are together, I feel she likes me too (she hugs me and gives me kisses). She also makes plans for the next date but it usually never happens (because later she's in a bad mood and wants to stay home). 

I'm trying to be supportive. I have no experience with mental illnesses so I watched many videos and read some articles to understand her better. But after those 5 months there was no change, we are stuck in the same spot. I feel like she gets scared when she lets me closer and then she pushes me away again. I'm really confused with her behavior and I don't know what's going on in her head. I asked her directly if she takes me as a friend or a boyfriend. She only said she had to think about it because she was not sure. And she hasn't texted me since (it was 6 days already). 

I think we have so much in common, she's sweet and caring and I really don't want to lose her. But it's really exhausting and I feel anxious when I'm thinking about it. My friends say to let her go. Please help! What do you think? Should I wait for her to MAYBE get better someday?

1jequ67,1742366092.0,"Time to Deal With It Hey everyone.
I’m new to this kind of public speaking. I normally push things away and try to figure it out on my own, but I’m rather tired of doing it so I’m going to give this a try.
About a year and a half ago I was very depressed, didn’t want to get out of bed, go to classes, answer calls, etc. My hair took a ton of damage from what I assume would be the stress, I have plenty of grey hairs growing in on the sides and my hair was extremely thin when it’s very thick. I also had a lot of weight gain which I assume was from the lack of exercise/getting out of the house. My self esteem fell here. I was doing double the work in school, plus I had a lot of toxic relationship drama and a lot of family issues. I find my family can’t ever have a good year, always an accident, death, cancer diagnosis, etc. So here was my overall experiences: up all night, slept all day. Always exhausted. Zero sex drive. Zero appetite. I was always sick/sore in some way or another. Visually unappealing, dark under eyes, shitty hair, etc. Thoughts of death. After the year ended I went to work, and I found a lot of changes in my life. I was happy, my hair got thick again, the weight stayed, but I slept like normal, I didn’t have any death thoughts, felt energized. 
I’m back in a rut. I have nothing to do all day, I have trouble falling asleep, trouble waking up, my face has gotten very round, I don’t leave the house other than to drive somewhere & visit/shop so I guess not much exercise, don’t really want to leave the house, no sex drive with a partner, toxic relationship which will be ending in the next few weeks, sick all the time/sore. I’m essentially back to square one. Is it time to throw in the towel and say “hey, clearly this will never go away” and just start popping pills from the doctor and hope it works, or is this something I can turn around on my own without needing prescriptions? Last time this happened I had gotten myself to go to bed early, go to more classes, go to the gym everyday, make regular meals, etc. My boyfriend at the time didn’t like that I was going to bed too early in our long distance relationship so he regularly had hissy fits and thought I should stay up later because he was 3 hours behind. It was working but agreeing to his idea fucked it all up. Am I just one of those people who need to be always on a schedule or I will go off the rails, or will these prescriptions of anti-depressants or whatever just do it for me?

Or least that’s how i feel at this very moment or within the last few hours

The football just entered the international break which was the one thing keeping me semi sane least i have the f1 i guess,the friends i used to play with semi frequently have vanished but i’ve come to peace with that fact they may pop up on occasion but it’s nothing to look forward to or rely on

I finally got myself a keyboard to play music with again so that’s good and recently got back into cooking,although i think it’s inevitable to get to the negatives

The last few months all i’ve really done in both a literal and figurative sense is vegetate in my home sit/lay around playing games or watching youtube

I’ve noticed fat on my body alot more from a mix of excessive eating from boredom and the lack of movement i mentioned before,because as i said i don’t really go anywhere

Dont have anyway to really go or the motivation too

Honestly memories came flashing back to me not bad although aleast they don’t feel bad to me back in February march of last year. At that time i was deeply suicidal but the one saving grace was just going out into the dark night.

Many thoughts went through my head when i used to walk to that park,what people would think if i did,how people would react,what it would be like,how I’d achieve it and i guess finally if i would…but in a way i dont know if it was the night sky and the cool breeze or what it was but those nights felt very peaceful 

Some were just to scout the area to find trees for my rope to hang on,other times i went down rushing with blood or overwhelmed by pain to achieve what i wanted

Often the night would often calm me before i got there or as i arrived other times this wasn’t the case but i’m more fondly remembering those more peaceful times

Am i wishing to be suicidal again,no nor am i saying i’m feeling that pleak but those midnight walks are one of the few things i do miss,would i do them again

Not exactly without a real purpose why would i? But i certainly miss some of the things i’d feel those nights of what i felt would be reflections i had

But for better or worse those days are in the past but i guess the question is more so now what exactly do i do with my life

Continue doing what i’ve been doing wake up everyday mindlessly brainrot on games or my phone cook myself a meal sit and lay around all day go to my parents for tea come back and repeat with the occasional break in routine when i spend time with one of my friends when they show up

I mean…i’m not sure what else…as i said i got the keyboard now…would be nice to get some excise i suppose i just don’t necessarily have a way or a reason or the motivation to

I think what i’m doing really is just trying to survive keep myself sane day to day with the little resources i have

I guess i try not to focus too much on the circumstances and situations around me,i mean practically everywhere i look it just seems like everyone has things better than i

Great group of friends,loving families,healthy life and work balance etc etc,i know you can pull the whole looks are deceiving and perhaps people haven’t got it as good as they make out and i’m not saying that is the case for everyone but i just know there is many cases were people are just genuinely happier about themselves and the environments they find themselves as opposed to my own self

But again it’s not healthy to pay attention to those details so i continue to chug forward hoping one day maybe my circumstances will change or an opportunity will present itself ",1,0,0,"reflection sorts honestly nowadays find place apathy , feeling anxious depressed miserable underlyingly perhaps generally feel indifferent unphased numb least feel moment within last hours life necessarily exciting way , much going , much get bed look forward football entered international break one thing keeping semi sane least f1 guess , friends used play semi frequently vanished come peace fact may pop occasion nothing look forward rely finally got keyboard play music good recently got back cooking , although think inevitable get negatives last months really done literal figurative sense vegetate home sitlay around playing games watching youtube noticed fat body alot mix excessive eating boredom lack movement mentioned , said really go anywhere anyway really go motivation honestly memories came flashing back bad although aleast feel bad back february march last year . time deeply suicidal one saving grace going dark night . many thoughts went head used walk park , people would think , people would react , would like , would achieve guess finally wouldbut way know night sky cool breeze nights felt peaceful scout area find trees rope hang , times went rushing blood overwhelmed pain achieve wanted often night would often calm got arrived times case fondly remembering peaceful times wishing suicidal , saying feeling pleak midnight walks one things miss , would exactly without real purpose would ? certainly miss things would feel nights felt would reflections better worse days past guess question exactly life continue wake everyday mindlessly brainrot games phone cook meal sit lay around day go parents tea come back repeat occasional break routine spend time one friends show meani sure elseas said got keyboard nowwould nice get excise suppose necessarily way reason motivation think really trying survive keep sane day day little resources guess try focus much circumstances situations around , mean practically everywhere look seems like everyone things better great group friends , loving families , healthy life work balance etc etc , know pull whole looks deceiving perhaps people got good make saying case everyone know many cases people genuinely happier environments find opposed self healthy pay attention details continue chug forward hoping one day maybe circumstances change opportunity present"

1je9jhv,1742316467.0,"I've lost my ability to read When I try to talk about depression there is always a black wall that appears in my mind, because I've learned people don't want to and/or can't understand it. Maybe writing about it will be different. 

I have lost my ability to do most of the things I love; most recently, I've lost my ability to read. I'm old enough to where half of my life I have existed severely depressed, and even though nothing is harder than seeing your own actions - thoughts, mental states, ""realizations,"" opinions - from an outside, nonpersonal POV, I think I have been able to witness my downfall at certain points of my life. (And similarly, lately, I've been able to see many points in my life where I think I've changed and told myself I've changed and tried for force ""change,"" but really I've never changed at all. We never really change when we think we do; the times we really change always happen outside of our awareness - trauma is always trauma because it isn't expected or anticipated.)

I have always struggled to read because of depression and ADHD, but I have always been able to force myself to read and learned to enjoy it (after all, we love entertainment - I love movies, shows, games, books, STORIES - and books, imo, are just the most superior form of entertainment around if you can focus on hallucinating words for large stretches at a time lol). For the last decade books have been the largest sources of joy in my life. Sometimes I'll go through periods where it's really hard to read, but I will usually started supplementing that with audiobooks, and just accept that it's ok if I'm struggling to read because I'll pick it back up when I'm less depressed.

Well lately I've not been any less depressed than suicidal depression. I have been unable to focus on anything besides trying to fill my days with work, food (but not too much so I don't feel like shit), sexual pleasure, drugs (but not too much so I don't feel like shit), video games, sleep, then wake up and do it all again until I finally work up the courage to hang myself. I feel nothing and I don't want to feel anything (I really DO want to feel something, still, at some level, but I can't FEEL that Want at all anymore; usually, in the past, I've been able to pretend - fake it till it becomes real: placebo is very real shit). 

Depression has been a gradual decline for me but sometimes I swear there are Steps, and I'll look back and see Oh, that was a large drop right there, goodbye another fragment of Me. Half a year ago another such step down happened to me and my mind has been unable to recover because there is nothing to ""recover:"" this is me now, just as assuredly as all the past you's are you.

This doesn't mean I'm going to just flip over and die; I'm still going to try develop my mindset and philosophy on life, as long as I'm alive, and I will still do things like try my best to listen to books and read here and there wherever I can, and maybe do things like socialize at least once a month (maybe...

1jeehx2,1742328446.0,"Still having symptoms I'm what I think of as pretty heavily medicated, buspirone, bupropion, and trintellix. And while the most concerning symptoms (suicidal ideation and pervasive sense of hopelessness) have been controlled, I'm still feeling numb or cut off from my emotions, and I'm struggling to take care of myself and my home. I never used to have an issue with hygiene but now I only shower on days I'm leaving the house, and since I wfh and we're a one car household, that's like, maybe once every 10 days. This past weekend we were meeting some friends and it took me at least 30 minutes to brush all the tangles from my hair. 

My kitchen has been full of the same dirty dishes since valentine's day, and in my bedroom, you can't see the floor because of all the (clean and folded) laundry in baskets. I was supposed to have labs drawn three times over the course of the last year, and to schedule an appointment to follow up on a pituitary tumor, and i haven't done that, or made my yearly ob-gyn appointment, I've been meaning to switch physicians and haven't done that. I know I would feel better if I went to bed on time consistently, and exercised daily, and meditated, and journalled, and did yoga, etc, etc, etc. It's like I've constantly got a to do list running through my head and even when I break it down, lower my expectations, etc, I just can't. 

I keep telling myself I need to do things: ten minutes in the kitchen, go for a walk outside in the sunshine, shower, and i just can't. I don't know how to shake this executive dysfunction or whatever it is, and I'm scared to change up my meds because I hated feeling like that. 

I'm in talk therapy and I just don't know how to do it right, I guess? I don't understand how exploring my issues is going to translate into me getting my shit together.

It's the lowest stress job I've ever had, I'm making enough to keep up with my husband and we're paying our bills with money leftover. I have the capability and support to take care of my health. I have a good social structure. But at the same time, in some ways, I'm doing the worst I've ever done.

1je6jbe,1742308862.0,"I am an absolute mess and I don't know what to do. I've been struggling with depression since high school (so about 7+ years from what I can remember). Just for some context, I also have ADHD and a history of binge eating disorder (which I had under control since 2023, but it's starting to creep back in...). I also notice that my mood drops significantly in the winter when there's less sunlight, so that could be playing a role too. Honestly, I’m just feeling confused and desperate at this point.

On the surface, my life is pretty normal. I’m in my early 20s, finishing up school, and trying to land my first ""big girl"" job (woohoo!). I have a solid group of friends, and when I’m out of my apartment, I’m usually fun and outgoing. But when I’m home—just me and my three cats—it’s a completely different story.

For most of my life, my depression has been manageable. But lately, I’ve been spiraling, and I don’t understand why. I used to always keep a clean home, but now? My apartment is a disaster. I haven’t cleaned my bedroom in months, and I avoid it by sleeping on my couch. It isn't just my bedroom either... Every time I tell myself to clean, I just shut down because I don’t even know where to start.

I’ve also stopped taking care of myself the way I used to. Skincare, hygiene, simple self-care routines—I used to be on top of it all, and now I can barely brush my teeth every night. Showers feel like a chore, and I only do the bare minimum so I don’t smell bad in public. On top of that, my eating habits are out of control. I barely eat all day, then binge at night, only to wake up hating myself for it.

Socially, I’ve also changed a lot. I’m an introvert, but I’ve always been social and made an effort to see my friends. Now, I cancel plans last minute or avoid making them altogether. The weird part? When I originally say yes, I genuinely want to go. But as the day approaches, I get overwhelmed with anxiety and dread, and I end up bailing.

I don’t feel like I can turn to my parents—they either don’t understand or don’t want to acknowledge what I’m going through. I’ve been to therapy before and even scheduled an appointment recently, but with money being tight, it’s just not an option right now. My sister would probably help if I reached out, but I don’t even know how to ask or how much of this I’m comfortable letting her see. Truthfully, I feel embarrassed by it all. I used to love having friends over at my apartment, but now? I wouldn’t dare let anyone see it in the state it’s in.

The thing is, I really want to get better. I want to be how I was a year ago—healthy, clean, happy, doing the things I love, and maintaining it all. I know I can do it. I just don’t know where to start or how to push myself. The motivation is just gone.

No one needs you, but they will find you.  Leave get out end it today, I need them to stop but they will not.

1je4sru,1742304089.0,"Mil problems So if you clicked on this post the title is a bit misleading. I am having problems with my mother in law. But not the typical kind. I’m 29 years old and met my husband in high school. Then I met his mom. She was a drug addict and he would have to leave school to go pick her up from wherever she was crashing, or go get her stuff because she didn’t have a car and she decided she was hopping to the next couch or whatever. Her son and I dated for 3 years, broke up for 4 and somehow got back together again. By the time we met each other again he owned a house which to my surprise his mother still lived at. 

I absolutely resented the idea of living with her. She’s dirty and smokes cigarettes all the time, falls off the wagon quite frequently and I’ve begged and pleaded with my husband to kick her out and he just tells me “she’s going to do drugs no matter where she goes so I’d rather her be here and safe while she does it” and I understand this way of thinking. I’d rather not have to be the person that asks her husband to choose between two people he loves. So she bought a camper to put in our front yard -_-

So anyways, she got cancer. And she went through chemo and the whole nine yards and went into remission but now there’s something else wrong. She screams in pain 24/7. The whole house will be quiet and all of a sudden you hear her getting up from the couch to go smoke and she’s yelling at the top of her lungs. She withered away to nothing. Won’t eat, won’t get off the couch, can’t shower, can’t get to the bathroom. She can’t do anything besides cry and scream in pain. Just 2 night ago I had to call 911 because we thought she overdosed. She drs have her on every kind of pain medication imaginable. It’s really ironic that the drugs that she chose over her kids would be the ones the she now can’t live without. She walks through the house and stops and bend over and scream to God to just take her and she doesn’t want to live anymore. All that being said I have 2 kids. Again, I’m here pleading with my husband to take care of this because I’m so fed up. 

I can’t get out of bed, I can’t get dressed for the day, I’m falling behind on appointments, I’m also a college student about to graduate in a few months. There’s just this darkness that’s taken over my house and I know I’m depressed. I’ve tried to tell my husband she needs to go somewhere else. I actually told him that he was going to have to put her somewhere or we were going to have to find somewhere else to go. In the midst of all this, he decided to take a 24/7 job for the next two months. And now this depression is turning into anger. I feel like her care is being pushed onto me because I’m a stay at home mom right now and he’s just running away. Is it possible to just resent someone so much? I don’t hate her but I’m done. I cannot do this anymore. It took some old guy at his work to tell him it’s not healthy for the kids for him to actually do something. She needs physical therapy but she can’t walk to her car to go. The palliative care team says there’s no way for her to be put anywhere because her insurance won’t cover it. And I can’t really talk to her about it, because she’s understandably emotional. I’m half afraid she going to take a handful of drugs to just end it. I think I’m going to reach out to my primary and see if I can get on some depression meds. It’s not my first rodeo with them but it does suck to get better and then fall back into depression because you can’t control your surrounding. 

Growing up, I lived with a narcissistic mother who kicked me out on the streets when she had my brother. (We’re 11 years apart) and I hopped from grandparents to other family members to friends, and I’ve since cut contact with her. I realized that my depression stemmed from my environment so I tried my best to change it. I’m an adult I should be able to do that or so I thought. I wanted a better life and I wanted a better life for my kids. So how the hell did I end up here? Anyways yeah if you’ve made it through this far I really appreciate it. I have no one to talk to and it’s such a crazy situation I’m not even sure how to reach out to someone to talk to about it. Btw I’m actually a really emotional person, I’m just honestly fed up with raising my MIL.

1je9x5o,1742317411.0,"Should i reduce my full time job (chronic severe depression)? There are days, where i feel certain regarding that decision and days where i'm unsure (and full-time would be better financially). 

I am severely depressed but high-functioning. I've been working in my new job for about a year: A smaller office, because i deemed it better for my mental health (the job before was absolute stress and hell). I like working there, the pay is excellent. The only downer are my colleagues: Girls who are b!tchy and mean for no reason, love to make fun of you (stuff like that). 

That would be one of the reasons, why i want to reduce (very stressful longterm). I also feel in general that a 4 workday-week would be better for my mental health (have to fight a lot of inner demons atm, apart from work). 

As a consequence i wanted to reduce my job from 100 % to 80 %. I didn't think it would make much of a difference but i'd be earning about 400 dollars less (which is a hugh difference to me). Financially i'd get no problems, but still. I also have to pay off a huge loan :/.

At at the same time i sense, that i won't be able to do this for much longer :/. Also thought about looking for a new job...but such a work environment is almost everywhere now, so that would be kinda useless.

1je8xpi,1742314976.0,"Bummed Out After 2-Week International Trip Writing this post as a way to vent. I recently got back from a trip halfway across the world with a woman (let’s call her Brooke) I met last summer.

Brooke and I met on a dating app during the summer of 2024, and we hit it off right away. Went on several dates, texted/talked every day, had sex, etc. This lasted about a month until I had to move 1,000 miles away for my job for an indefinite amount of time. We continued to talk/text every day, as I knew the move was most likely temporary. I came home a few times, and everything with her and I seemed good, until about a month after I left when I came home again, and we went to a sporting event together. She seemed to be a bit down and moody with me, wasn’t talking much. I drive her home, and she doesn’t invite me in (as she usually would have), and I take that as a bad sign. Afterwards, I never texted her, and she never texted me. So, it just basically fizzled out that night…

Until roughly two months later, I learned that I would returning home from my work stint. It was also around the holidays, and I happened to be home for a family wedding. I had started thinking more about her (I had really not thought much about after we fizzled out) and how I missed talking to her, so I reached out with a note and flowers. I basically apologized for the way things fizzled out and told her how much I enjoyed being around her, etc.

About a week or so goes by, and I get a text from her saying she enjoyed her time with me too. We get to texting back and forth, and eventually we set up a date for a week later. We go on a couple dates, and then I even schedule a trip to a beach town the week before the holidays which I tell her is my treat. Things seem to be back on track.

The two dates before the trip, and the trip, were a bit different than what I remember our interactions were back in the summer. She seemed to have her walls up and seemed just generally moody. It was odd. The trip was only 3 days, but most of the time on the trip she was super quiet and just generally seemed upset with me. Mind you, I’m one of the most laid-back guys out there, and have never fought with past girlfriends, so her having an attitude with me was an odd thing for me to experience. I never questioned her about it, or made it seem like I was having a bad time, but I certainly noticed her disposition. There was nothing I did to upset her; she did mention something at one point about seasonal depression, which I would venture to guess she has some degree of based on her recent disposition.

The two dates before the trip, we weren’t intimate, but the second night on the trip I made a move. I was in the midst of foreplay on her, and all was going well, until I got to the main act and then after about 2 minutes of it, she said stop and started crying. I had never experienced this before, and I was in shock and felt completely awful. I console her and she just still seemed to have her walls up. Funny enough, we had one day left on the trip, and that day seemed to be the best of all 3 as she was more playful with me.

So after the trip, I try to keep a text dialogue going with her and I can tell she is being a bit distant. She says she still wants to hang out (i.e., mentioned wanting to go to a sporting event in our town), but whenever I try to schedule something, I get excuses. So, at that point, I chalk it up as a lost cause and stop initiating texts. After several days though, she will send a random text, I’ll respond and then she basically doesn’t keep the conversation going. It’s very odd. Then eventually, she checks in and asks what I’m doing for a certain event. This is where things get interesting.

After this text, we somehow get into a conversation about how badly we want to visit a certain country halfway across the world. It all happened so fast, and next thing I knew we were planning on visiting this country in approximately 40 days. I booked the flights, they were super cheap relative to normal, and we were all set to go.

I honestly couldn’t believe we were doing this, but the flights were booked, and I really did want to go see this country and I thought when else am I going to have a chance other than the one right in front of me.  So, I booked the flights, but there was a ton of planning and whatnot that had to take place.

Over the course of the next 40 days before the trip, I made attempts to keep dialogue going but she just never seemed to keep the conversation going for any period of time. It was very odd. So I told her I will put together a draft itinerary and send it to her to make any comments/adjustments as I didn’t want to completely monopolize the trip. The trip was roughly 2 weeks long, and we wanted to see several different cities, some of which were 300+ miles apart. Eventually, I booked all these different hotels and activities and sent it to her with ample notice as we could have canceled them and gotten refunded, but I wanted to make sure we had at least something booked so weren’t stranded.

She thanks me and says how impressed she is that I did all this and that she would take a look at the multi-page itinerary I drafted up. There are several weeks until the trip, but she never really gets back to me about the itinerary with any comments or suggestions. The one thing she does do is call me about out of the blue several weeks before the trip and I can tell she is a bit nervous/trying to figure out how to word things, but she essentially asks what is your motive and to not expect a relationship out of this trip. I tell her I have no ulterior motive and that I wasn’t expecting a relationship to come of this trip. We are going to split all the bills of the trip. Fine and dandy. I will treat the trip 100% as if we are platonic friends, which at this point is what it seemed like anyways as we haven’t talked much lately.

We are getting closer to the trip and I’m legit wondering if she is even going to go. In the back of my head, I’m actually thinking it might be better if she doesn’t—I’ve made up in my mind I am definitely going whether she goes or not as I really wanted to see this area of the world. We get down to the final days before the trip, and she texts “I feel like we haven’t really talked much about this trip” which in my mind I find hilarious because she hasn’t engaged in any conversation I’ve tried to start.

The day of the trip comes, and we both show up at the airport. She seems in decent sprits initially. We travel the 20+ hours to our destination and embark on the trip. Initially, things are good, she doesn’t have much of an attitude like she has had with me the times we met in December.  But as the trip goes on, she gets super moody as she has in the recent past with me. She definitely seems like she is depressed or something. I never question her or bring up anything about her attitude, I am just trying to make it through the trip having as good of a time as possible.

It shortly gets to a point though where I can’t even communicate with her. I’ve noticed ever since I began talking to her again (in December), she doesn’t ever ask me anything about myself/my life/my family, etc., so the conversations don’t really last. I will ask her plenty of questions about her and her life, and that’s how the conversation even lasts a little bit of time, but she doesn’t really seem to want to talk to me. Her answers are short, and she speaks very softly, and it’s extremely difficult to keep a conversation going with her.

During the trip, we are sleeping in the same bed but as mentioned earlier, I treat it as friends and don’t make any moves. I don’t want things to get awkward. A few days in I’m sitting on the bed as she is in the bathroom taking a shower. Her phone was right on the nightstand next to me, and it lights up and my reptilian brain can’t help but be drawn to the stimuli. I look over and see a text pop up from a guy saying, “Have you told your bf you are with about me yet \*laughing emoji\* \*fingers crossed emoji\*”. I see it and although it kind of hurts a bit, I think whatever life goes on. I never mention anything about seeing it, but when she gets back from the shower she eventually gets to her phone and makes a face after looking at it. I say “what’s wrong”, and she goes “nothing, I just got a weird text”. She does not know I saw the text and I play dumb as if I never saw anything. I’m not sure if she made the face because she was confused about the guy calling me “her boyfriend” or if she was confused about the guy asserting that her and him were a thing.

Anyways, as the trip goes on, we get to a point where she seems to absolutely despise me. Which is so odd as I’ve been bending over backwards to treat her well and make the trip go as smoothly as possible. We are barely talking as any time I try to start a conversation she basically kills it. Soon, she snaps at me over a few innocuous comments I make when trying to start conversation; one comment I made was about how everything costs so much these days and how it is getting harder to support a family on a $100k household income—I meant nothing bad by this, I was simply trying to keep a conversation going. She goes something like “how rude of you to make that comment! Not everyone makes as much money as you!”. I do make very good money but I’m the least flashy person you will ever meet (she’s even mentioned so in the past about how I never spend money on myself). I actually despise a lot of the elitists I work with and am as far from one of them as possible. I couldn’t believe how she took my comment, and I immediately told her I apologize if it came off wrong, I didn’t mean anything nasty by it, I was merely trying to keep a conversation going.

The next day, things are still dire but I’m trying to put on a happy face and get out of the trip alive. She still is miserable, just incredibly moody. We get to talking about life after college and how different it is, and I make an innocuous comment about how when one graduates a silver lining is being somewhat independent (I meant this as how hard it is to get by right after school as I lived with my parents for a bit). I didn’t mean anything bad by this at all, but she took it as a dig apparently, saying “I AM INDEPENDENT!”. I tell her I’m sorry if it came off that way but I didn’t intend it to and that it was nothing about her at all—quite the opposite as I mentioned how impressed I am with her and how accomplished she is.

Nonetheless, she’s still pissed and at this point I feel like I’m walking around with a rain cloud above my head at all times. I am miserable, and we still have like a week left of the trip. I am at such a loss, that later that day as she is pouting and refusing to talk to me, I say as calmly and politely as possible, “maybe we should go our own separate ways the rest of the trip, this doesn’t seem to be working”. This sends her into a full-on breakdown, as she starts crying hysterically and saying she didn’t come halfway across the world with me to end up going separate ways.

At this point we are getting on a 4-hour train ride, we sit down in separate seats and let the time pass. From this point on, somehow things get a lot better. Despite in general still being a bit moody, she eventually warms up to me and acts playful like we did with each other back in the summer. The rest of the trip goes really well, I was taking pictures for her, and she was commenting how nice it was the effort I was putting in for her on the pictures and whatnot. We go to restaurants and bars together and are back to joking around with each other like when we first met. It really is wild the turnaround. And I know it’s wild, but the end of the trip was so nice that I really began enjoying being with her.

We get back home after a solid 5 days or so of a good end to the trip, and she playfully texts me about how she had a hard time getting into her apartment. I text her back and then a day or so later I say something to the effect of “hope you had a good day back to work” to which she says thanks and asks how mine was. I respond and try to keep the conversation going mentioning something about another trip she has planned soon. No response.

It’s been a week or so since the trip and no communication, and I would be surprised if there is any going forward. Oddly enough, despite how rough things got early on in the trip, I miss her. I absolutely loved the region we visited and the trip to me was an incredible experience. I felt like towards the end of the trip we really bonded. I don’t expect anything, but part of me just feels bummed that I can spend all this time with someone and then poof, they are just gone from your life. I booked everything for the trip, figured out all the logistics, planned all the activities, and she didn’t seem to really appreciate any of that. I was basically just a tour guide for her at the end of the day (she did make some flippant comment at one point early on in the trip that she wanted to go to this area so badly she would have gone with just about anyone that asked her).",1,0,0,"bummed 2week international trip writing post way vent . recently got back trip halfway across world woman let us call brooke met last summer . brooke

1je7jz7,1742311499.0,"(48M) Breakup, depression, anxiety and support groups? Looking for help... I broke up with my girlfriend last night, again. We had broken up over a month ago but could not go contactless, so I fell into the routine again and started overthinking and making plans and ideas of building a future with her. She was very dry and emotionless. I love her so much and truly wanted a life together. I feel like she was the one, but she could never see things from another perspective. It was always my fault, she stresses that she had never done anything wrong, even when given example. She would write me 7-page letters about everything that was wrong with me, what she needs, and could never answer a question without answering it with another question. I am seeing a Psychiatrist and Therapist. Both have been great. I feel great when I speak with them for the entire day, but then the 5 other days of the week, I just lay down on the couch with a blanket and fall asleep, no matter what time. For years I've thought that my family and friends would be better off in a world without me. I wanted to go to sleep and never wake up. 

Now, with this breakup, my depression and anxiety are thru the roof. My hands shake, I keep dozing off and when I am alone at home, I have these thoughts and visualize looking down at my body, laying there, dead. 

When asked, are you suicidal, my answer has always been, thoughts, perhaps, but never the strength to do anything.  

These past few days have passed, I just feel closer and stronger toward ending my life. SO that family and friends don't need to babysit me because of my depression or emotional moods. My only fear is that I want to go painlessly, and I always read people that try to OD may fail and cause their bodies to malfunction in some way. I've thought about a warm bath and cutting my wrists. I don't know. I'm not scared of what comes next. I'm tired of hearing ""this too shall pass"" or ""it takes more courage to stay here and go thru the motions versus ending your life"". What people don't realize is that pain that I've had inside of me for most of my life, sometimes less painful, sometimes more, but I have hidden it so well for so many years. 

I just want the pain to stop, its situational but also seasonal for the most part, from what I've led people to believe. Please, don't judge. I don't think this is purely because of the breakup, but I'd be an idiot if I said it didn't add to it. She was the One, still could have been, but she refuses to seek help or discuss things with a professional. I know we could work thru things if there was a third party advising, but I can't help her if she believes there's nothing wrong with her. I love her and love the life we had planned together, but the constant blaming thing and controlling thing, I just can't see myself doing that the rest of my life. She says she loves me, but then why is something that would be a simple fix be so difficult? 

I was wondering, how would someone go about looking for a grief or depression support group, a place to open up with those like me...

Last year was a particularly uphill battle against all of my problems and I ended up loosing myself and tried to kill my self on multiple occasions, escalating in severity each time. I've always felt like I'm a burden to everyone, my family, my friends and other loved ones, but now I know that it's not just something in my mind but it's true. I was meeting someone at my university, and things were going well with him, I still had this dread looming above me, intrusive thoughts of not being worth a friendship with him or anyone for that matter, I really tried to keep it everything inside of me (I know that's bad but it's the only way I now), but I couldn't help but harm myself, try to commit suicide. And this ended screwing my relationship with this friend.

It was never my intention to do this, I've never wanted to cause pain to others, but I did, to someone that was very special to me. On November from last year, he told me he wanted space, he wanted to distance himself from me, and of course I understood why, and tried to give him that space, but it still hurt so much, and now classes have resumed and I tries talking to him, to apologize, to try and make things right, but he told me that ""He doesn't want to do anything with me"" and that he just doesn't care anymore. I feel an unbearable guilt, a crippling loneliness that grows everyday, as all my other friends are in common with him, and they all spend time together, at most the others wave their hand at me, but not much else.

I have to add that since the incident in November I sought better treatment for my problems and I have managed to leave my suicide attempts and self harm behind me, I want to be better, I want people to know that I can be much more than just my mentally illnesses, but after all of these recent events, I'm starting to think about suicide again, haven't done or planned anything just yet, but It's still something that lingers on my mind, and it is slowly becoming stronger. I hate that I fucked things up so spectacularly that I don't even get a second chance to prove I can change, I hate that now I really feel alone, it's not just in my head anymore, I am the architect of my own downfall, I never wanted things to turn this way, and now I just feel hopeless, without purpose.

For background I am a 32 year old guy who has struggled with severe depression pretty much constantly from the age of 13 through age 30. When I was 30 I finally made some important decisions to fix some of the major issues contributing to my depression and it gave me the momentum to keep making good changes that brought my mental health to an all time high. To the point where recently I've been taking care of myself; meditating, cultivating positive energy, working on my inner thoughts, working out, practicing yoga, basically all the things that can boost your mood. I was back to my happy hippie self. That is until 2 days ago.
I was driving from work, heading to meet my girlfriend at the gym, and suddenly it was like a split second change. Like lightning struck me and that lightning was the deep depression I've always struggled with. Like a switch flipped and everything was back.
Every other depressive episode I've ever had was gradual. A slippery slope until I'm at rock bottom not realizing how far I'd slid. This was very inorganic feeling. Unnatural.

1jdtr89,1742261627.0,"Help me please! How the fuck do I get my life together? I’m a 25 year old woman. I currently sleep on the couch at my parent’s house, which consists of my grandparents living in an adjacent house (apartment? Two homes together). My dad remarried and though my step family is nice, I find myself isolating from them whenever I feel very anxious or paranoid. I honestly don’t feel comfortable around any of them.

And people tend to come over to the house often. I don’t feel safe and I can’t relax. I’m hyperventilated all the time. My family loves to have friends and family over. Today is my uncle’s birthday and I’m currently hiding in my father’s room under his bed. It’s not about how I feel. It’s his birthday so I need to stop being so self centered. 

I came out of the room to great everyone and then I retreated back to my dad’s room because my bed is often used as a place for everyone to sit. And the kids love to eat on it. 

I have severe social anxiety, ocd and depression. I know to survive in this world you need to be around people. And honestly I let so many opportunities slip me by. I keep thinking about going to college but I keep pushing it off to different semesters. 

I use an excuse that I’m worried about debt. I really am and I’m a new Florida resident so I won’t be able to get Florida residency right away. By the way if I didn’t leave to go back to my mom’s when I was 24, I could have gotten tuition under my father. 

I’m seriously a dumb and pathetic immature bitch! I know I need to be patient but every day I think about leaving and just living on the streets. Or you know not waking up ever again but I’m a big coward. I’m tired of moving back and forth between my family with no direction in my life. I’m stupid and I literally don’t know how to put my life together. 

I currently don’t have a job. I haven’t had one for 2 years. I barely worked since I first turned 20. I think I had only 3 jobs during these 5 years. I have chronic pain (fibromyalgia but I’m honestly not sure if it’s that) but it seems to flare up with stress. And I was a dumbass. When I went back to South Carolina to live with my mother and then later my grandmother. I got to see a doctor but I was worried about medical bills. And I gave up too quickly when I tried medicine due to some bad sides.

Every chance I’ve had to change my life. I ruined it. By the way, I know I’m being ungrateful. I have a roof over my head, food to eat and my parents take care of my basic needs. So the lack of privacy should be the least of my worries. I help watch my brothers on school days. I feed my brother lunch though my grandma tends to help me feed him breakfast sometimes because he’s a picky eater. But I’m really bad at babysitting. And getting my brother from the bus stop every day gives me anxiety because I have to be around people. 


I’m currently on antidepressants. I see a psychiatrist. I’m getting a new therapist. And I still talk to my old one from South Carolina. I went the hospital a couple times after calling the ambulance for suicidal ideation. And on thanksgiving I went to the hospital for taking fucking 10 Benadryls. Because I talk to a hotline about how I was feeling. I’m only about to get antidepressants through my mother’s insurance who’s still in South Carolina. I feel like a failure. A woman child. I keep thinking that I won’t be able to survive in this world. 


I know this is a lot of word salad but I feel so hopeless. I don’t know what to do. I was planning to go to goodwill’s job center on Friday to work on my resume. But I ended up crying in my dad’s room after greeting everyone and hearing them whisper about how pathetic I am for my age. This whole time I was feeling paranoid and everyone talking behind my back. My dad and my step family said it was all in my head. I was right the whole time. 

I keep thinking about running away even though I’m fucking 25. 
It will be the same no matter which family member I live with. And if I go back to my mother’s I’ll probably never try to get out there again. I’d hide away from the world in my tall tower. But I fear if not running away one day I’ll go to sleep forever. Again this is a lot and I’m sorry for all the word salad. This is kind of like a vent. If this isn’t the right group post in.

Things do not seem to work. I don't know why I am alive. I was involved in a brutal road accident a few weeks ago, but by some miracle made it out with a few scratches and a swollen arm. Still I do not feel gratitude. I dont have any friends whom I can share how I feel. I have grown up in an abusive household and It would be a lie if I say that I truly love my family. I hate the house I live in. Not because it is like the way it is, but because the adults in the house are nothing but pussies. They do not know how to deal with things, and always end up yelling and fighting over issues which can be solved. Along with it , i was good in academics until the last year, and my grades and interest in studies dropped significantly. It has been days since I have been to school, tuition, or touched any books for studying. I also asked a girl to be my friend, coz i kinda liked her throughout the last year but all she said was that she's sorry. No convo nothing.  
I always try to bring things to a better place, but by the end of the day, I realise the fact that I have failed miserably again. I don't have any relatives or cousins whom I can interact with, as our relations with them aren't good enough.
All i feel is loneliness and emptiness. I also have a exam to give next year, like mid jan'26. 
It is the 2nd most important exam i will give in my entire life and people usually prepare for it atleast 2 years. I haven't studied shit in the last year, since my mind is nothing but fucked up. Parents have silent expectations but they never listen to me. I feel nothing more than a burden to them. I am also not a good brother. I don't know whats going on in my sister's life at school, i dont know which things she studies, what friends she has, is she being bullied, idk. Whenever I try to talk to some old so called friends, they simply say they are busy and will call later. Those calls never come. I wait. But nothing happens. Now a days, i have also lost the ability to cry. I want to cry my heart out atleast to myself alone. Yet the tears dont come out. I feel emotionally numb and mentally ill. I am having weird dreams of my crush(the same girl above), soft rain falling on me, fucking dogs, jumping of a plane, and shits i cant explain. Out of self pity, i made a plan to fix everything a few days ago. Still not able to pick up any momentum on it. I also stopped working out for a year . now my muscles are weak. I am weaker than a 15yro girl who goes to gym regularly. I am a male, abt to be 17. I am also a bit fat, but not much.
I don't feel the joy to live anymore,something is pressing those desires to live inside my mind. I do not know whats happening to me. I spend all day inside my room, all windows and doors and curtains closed. In the darkness, i only use social media to do shit and mostly eat junk shit along with two meals cooked by mum.

1je1i43,1742292428.0,"What am I struggling with ? A long rant I apologize in advance.

Hey everyone, hope you're having a nice day.
Growing up, I always had very high anxiety; at that time, I didn't know what it was, and I recall telling my mom that I always felt like there was a""rock"" on my chest, preventing me from breathing.
I went through some traumatic experiences that shaped my childhood, and looking back now, I think I was dealing with some OCD-related symptoms. I used to have a very corrupted imagination and always had the urge to tell my mom about it. Mom either acted like it was fine or tried to comfort me a little until one day she broke completely and started crying, saying she doesn't know what to do with me.
At that time our only conclusion was that I'm""Too smart"" and ""too sensitive,"" and that's why I don't seem to act and perceive stuff normally like kids my age. Looking back, of course, my mom had to involve some type of consultation and take me to a psychiatrist or so, but I don't blame her; she didn't know better.

I grew up feeling very out of place and having this weird sensation in my chest. I excelled academically, and that's the only thing that made me feel good and kind of stop questioning what I was going through exactly, because at least I was getting some type of ""outcome."" 
For my underdeveloped brain at that time, it was like I was sacrificing something to get another thing, and I kind of accepted that I was sacrificing my well-being to at least have a ""good future.""
I see myself as an extroverted person; one of the reasons why I prefer people's company is the fact that my brain drains me so much when I'm alone. I immediately find something to ruin my mood completely and drive me to all the suicidal thoughts I have been struggling with pretty much since gaining consciousness, so I always wanted to have people around me. This, mixed with the fact that I'm super sensitive and insecure, ended up putting me in a lot of toxic friendships throughout my life, where I kind of look down at myself and idolize the other person.

Fast forward to now, not because there is nothing to tell but because it's already too much.
I'm in university, starting all over again at 21 because the situation in my country deteriorated so fast, and we had to leave the place. 
Starting all over again is definitely hard, but what makes it harder for me is the fact that I'm completely miserable. I have been waking up feeling the way I used to feel when I was 4 years old for 2 years now, really, really desperate and tired and with so, so much pain in my chest. 
I have been doing stuff just to feel good for a minute, wanting something to make me feel alive again, but everything is just killing me more. 
Most of the time I don't feel real; it's like I am stuck inside of myself, and there's no way out of it. No matter how hard I try, it gets worse and worse every time, every day.I don't want to do this anymore. The idea that I can die while sleeping is the only reason why I sleep. The idea that I can just kill myself anytime is what is keeping me alive, but I live in so much agony it makes no sense to keep doing it. Is this my fate forever?

1jdzq98,1742284088.0,"Everything is work (22f) This is more of a vent that probably belongs on r/depression. But I feel like other lonely people will understand. I stopped really caring about the world and being detached a long time ago. When you have to watch 100 people be fake nice when they meet you which turns into not so nice anymore once they get to know you its kind of over. 

When you realize that you have a time limit with people where they tolerate you for a bit and then the clock is just ticking after that until both you and them realize what you gotten into it's very sad.  

I could go through a whole bunch of reasons why life is tough right now but that's the major one. This could stem from never really having friends and not knowing what is like to get along with someone and have someone choose you. But it really is just hopeless at this point. 

Everything is work, (my dumbass being like this decided to get a roommate) so being at home is work. Either because of horrible undiagnosed ADHD or depression,  my brain is cooked and school is work.  Trying to socialize more with ppl outside of my roommate and finding someone to even tolerate me for a few days is work because of horrible social anxiety.  

Trying to work on something that could be my passion and bring  success is work. Nothing in my life is fun or easy.  I have nothing and it's not a bad or sad thing. I just have nothing to give anymore. Everyday I wake up and just hope I get through every useless interaction without saying ""who gaf I think about kms everyday"".

 Life shouldn't be getting through,  it shouldn't be ""what am I not looking forward to today?"" ""What's gonna stress me out so much that I can't sleep tonight?"" ""How will I get through the day sober?"" ""How am I going to fake smile if I have to see a person"" I don't belong anywhere and I quite literally can't mask that feeling anymore.  

I get why they say when people make up their minds about suiside there's no changing it.  Some people, There's no changing the circumstances that make not want to be here, unless maybe they can afford expensive therapy.

Someone could say the nicest thing to me right now. Try and convince themselves their helping me.

1jdtxeh,1742262136.0,"Lost everything at 32 Not sure where I start but I'll try. I'm a 32(M) who's recently lost everything. My home was recently burglarized and they stole everything I've worked for these past 3 years. For safety issues, I've had to my myself and children out of our home suddenly. I have no vehicle and two jobs to maintain. I had a hard upbringing young but have always persevered. As I get older however, it seems like the harder I try the more I lose or fail. And the resilience and strength I once had seems to fade away more and more. To the point I'm really starting to believe the world is better off without me. That maybe I've peaked at what I could be at life and it's time for me to hang it up. Mind you, I've never been suicidal but an accumulation of events these past 5 years has me greatly considering it.



The worst part of all of this, is I have a son who I am a single father to. He's 13 and very aware of what is going on. The thing is, I'm breaking in front of him. As a man, as a person, who once had hope. How do I go on like this and set an example for him? His mother left us 3 to almost 4 years ago and I've tried to handle raising him through my good and bad days the best I can. I'm working two jobs with no vehicle and lost my identity, myself. I'm an eldest son of the family and that doesn't ease my pressure one bit. 

I'm just wondering, has anyone lost the things most precious to them and recovered? I've lost the family I built, the finances I saved, the investments I made, and any true purpose to wake up in the morning other caring for my children. I find myself thinking if I died early enough, the memory of me would be more pleasant than failing to become the man I thought I would be by now. I know I can't be perfect but it just feels every genuine effort I make or joy I try to have gets snatched from me. I have no marketable skills other than a degree that's pretty useless atp. 


Death seems easy to be honest. Painful but easy. I won't have to wake up, upkeep an image that I'm fine, or fail at maintaining the things I hold close to my heart. I had no father growing up and wish I knew how to navigate myself through this. I wish I knew yo develop better habits when I was younger so it wouldn't be so hard to teach my son good ones while breaking my old ones. I just feel like a lost father.

1jdx4ss,1742272604.0,"Problems I'm posting here for the first time, I'm very desperate and I need help.

In 2022, I was diagnosed with depression, which came as a big shock to me, since I never showed many signs of it and always said, ""I'm too happy to be depressed."" However, looking back at what happened before the diagnosis, it's not a big surprise.

A few months earlier, I decided to take a break from social media because of a fight I had with my girlfriend. At the time, our relationship was complicated: we loved each other very much, but we had constant arguments and fights for silly reasons, such as me not replying properly to messages. During this period without social media, I began to feel extremely isolated and guilty about what had happened. I don't have anyone to talk to where I live, I haven't kept up my friendships from school and, as I live in a rural area, everyone lives far away from each other. My mind began to decline more and more. I realized that she had removed my name from social media, and I began to blame myself even more, to the point of considering cutting myself as a form of punishment for what I had done. Fortunately, I didn't have the courage to do that. I tried to turn to my girlfriend for help via WhatsApp, but she only replied with phrases like ""It'll be okay"" or ""Try to get help"", which didn't help at all. So I decided to ask my mother to help me find a psychologist, and luckily she did (it's very difficult to get this kind of help around here, so much so that I'm now without professional help). After the session with the psychologist, my girlfriend accepted me back, but to make matters worse, she told me that she had exchanged nudes with someone else while I was away. It was a very strong blow, a real punch in the gut. I pretended everything was fine and she apologized, but I felt awful. The same day, we had another fight, and it was devastating for me. I started crying and thinking about suicide, so I asked my mother to take me to hospital because I wasn't well. That's how I found out I had depression.

After that story, my girlfriend improved in some respects, and I managed to recover relatively well. However, something always seems to happen to hinder all progress. My girlfriend started to cling to me more, but in a way that isn't healthy. Basically, I've become her fuel, her motivation to get things done. What's more, she's become more sensitive when I'm tired or sad, always putting the blame on herself, even if I tell her it's not her fault. She doesn't even believe me when I tell her she looks beautiful, which breaks my heart. In short, this change has complicated things for me, because now I have to be careful with my feelings so as not to discourage her, since she could do something terrible because of it. She's too emotionally dependent on me, which is wearing me down. I feel like I have to be available 24 hours a day, otherwise she might do something drastic, and I'd blame myself for the rest of my life. I can no longer focus on my projects, play games or even sleep properly. I'm even ignoring my sleeping pills just to keep talking to her. The worst part is that I can't end the relationship. Despite her flaws, she's still the person I've loved most in my life, and I'm afraid that if we break up, she'll do something horrible. I only want what's good for her and I think she thinks the same, but I don't want her to be so dependent on me.

My girlfriend isn't the only reason I'm feeling this way. I remember acting aggressively towards some friends in the past, which resulted in fights and arguments. One of these fights left a deep impression on me, because my friend would always bring it up from time to time. I always apologized for what I had done, but this particular situation makes me feel much worse, because I think I may have completely changed the course of his life by being a horrible person. It just makes me think that I'm a bad person and that it makes sense that all this is happening to me. I always regret the things I do and apologize to everyone, but I still feel like a terrible person. These memories come back to torment and discourage me.

1jdwy6e,1742271918.0,"Another Birthday to remind me of my loneliness Another lonely birthday, another reminder that I’m getting older yet still not “straight” and “normal”.

Being a Pakistani-Canadian born, I had thought that my life would be a lot easier being myself but thats far from the truth. The way that society has grouped me being a brown, South Asian, Pakistani, Muslim and gay person, I just feel like I am constantly hated on for just being myself. My community openly persecutes Gays, than you have ordinary Canadians who are racist to me because of my Pakistani heritage or my skin colour.

Every time I try to be feminine or even I come off as slightly “flamboyant” or any hints of being queer, I am further harassed and emotionally abused. My siblings tell me to start being a man and stop using hand gestures when I walk. My friends tell me to stop being “sus or gay acting” in front of their parents. If I stay out late for even 10 mins, my parents are on my case and they consistently want me to marry a girl with so much pressure. My siblings emotionally abuse and torment me, my cousins and even many of my “straight” friends think something is wrong with me. I have to constantly put on a fake act of being a masculine man, who wants to get married to a women and take care of my parents in the future.

I am 29 years old and these societal pressures and immense amount of hatred towards every single identity and me has killed me alive. I am not just anxious or depressed, I also have severe trauma and PTSD from my childhood abuses. Each time I do find a guy I like, he uses me for sex and than leaves me when things get real or to marry a girl. I am abused for how I look as I have put on some weight due to my depression. Every second of everyday I feel like everyone around me mocks me or abuses me for existing. If it’s my brother or sister or extended family, parents or friends. Some of my friends force me into being religious in hopes that I will magically become straight. I just feel like killing myself everyday, I can’t truly be happy or myself because everyone hates me for either being a queer, a Muslim, Pakistani, a brown skinned person or anything else. I am living in constant sadness and each day I want to erase my existence. I am sick of feeling so alone. I cry myself to sleep, cry in my car, sometimes I feel like I need a hug but I cant even get that because I am a gay fag. 

No one cares about how I was violated multiple times when I was a kid or the fact that I have severe traumas from abandonment and growing as a Pakistani meant that my father expected me to be a straight man with no feelings and emotions. Having an emotional unavailable dad who was also abusive meant that I couldnt even feel any emotions when he would yell at me, belittle me or abuse me. I dont know how much longer I can live like this. I dont think as a gay person, we are allowed to be ourselves because society wants to torture you until you give up and die. 

Put on a positive note. I am trying to find hope everyday and it’s slowly working. Some days better than others. Some days things get better, other days they don’t. I am trying to move out and get my independence and maybe that will help me feel more free.

1jdwlw9,1742270670.0,"Feeling stuck and alone after a breakup. Struggling with depression, anxiety and loneliness. I’m in a really dark place right now, and I don’t know who to turn to. I’m just feeling completely stuck in life. For the past few years, I’ve been focused on trying to build a life with my ex. I put everything into that relationship, hoping for a future together, but he hurt me in so many ways—lying, cheating, breaking trust—and now I’m left with nothing but the aftermath.

He’s moved on, and I feel like I’m just stuck, constantly thinking about what went wrong. I feel like I’m living in a loop, endlessly replaying our conversations, the lies, the hurt, everything. I know I shouldn’t, but I keep looking at his social media, and it just makes it worse. I have no friends, no support system, and I feel so alone. Every day feels like I’m just waiting for things to get better, but nothing changes.

I don’t know how to move on. I have no real hobbies, no direction in life, and it feels like I’m wasting away. I feel like a failure at everything I try to do. I’m about to turn 29, and I have no job, no life outside of the mess my ex left me in, and I feel like I’ll never get out of this hole.

I’ve tried to push through it, but it’s just consuming me. I’m trying to focus on the future, but I feel hopeless. I know this is depression, but I just don’t know how to get better. I don’t know if I ever will. I don’t even know what kind of life I want anymore because I feel so lost.

Has anyone been in a similar place? How did you start to pull yourself out of it? I just need to hear that there’s hope and that it’s possible to heal.

Anyway I'm making the best of my job but most days it stresses me out. The new pharmacist is slow. Very slow. Ti the point where people have 2 to 3 hours for new scripts.

My love life is not existent. I get a attached way to easily. And that always leads to me messing things up. I have impulse control and autism so I text and call more then I should and I feel like that scare people away. I guess im lonely and want someone to wake up to.

All this to say I feel like ending myself would solve all these feelings if regret and hopelessness. I want to be happy but I hate myself. I hate my emotions and I wish I could be numb but that won't happen. I'm miserable. The only solace I have is in TV and media.

1jduuw2,1742264965.0,"I Finally Set a Date For the past 6 months I have been trying to decide when to pull the trigger. Last night I found out my Life Insurance policy will pay out in full regardless of how I die in a little over 2 months. The sense of relief is amazing. It is so strange how the most alive I have felt in years in planning to die.

I have spent the last couple of weeks paying off all of my wife's bills and moving money to a place where it is safe for her. I have been writing her letters, and letters to my kids. That is by far the hardest part. It makes me cry now just thinking of leaving them. My Journaling has been the only thing I look forward to in the day. I am trying so hard to explain, but really I am just explaining it to myself. Because I have never been able to understand why I cannot just be happy. I hope my wife and kids find all of these things some day,so everyone knows it is not their fault and it is just what I wanted. I'm not even depressed anymore. Having a date in mind is the first time I have felt happy in years.

It is getting close now. I am thinking about taking all of my flyer miles and credit card points and disappearing, or taking my family somewhere. It is hard because I have been trying to distance myself so they get used to me not being there. But all I want is to be around them right now. I am a lost soul.

1jdsg54,1742257790.0,"Pretty much lost all hope 
I first got prescribed an SSRI (sertraline) back in December, for depression and social anxiety.I started with 25mg a day, after I think about a month got it to 50mg and now a week ago to 100mg. 

I don’t think it has done anything for me(or at least not significant enough to notice). I’ve only got some side effects but no benefits yet. I heard it could take some time to reduce  your depression, but at this point I’ve pretty much lost all hope. I’ve also been in therapy for almost a year now and my mental state seems to have only gotten worse.
Because of this I even relapsed a few days ago, after being clean for about half a year.(poly substance addiction)

Therapy and medicine both haven’t seem to have helped at all, so far unfortunately the only things that actually have helped are drugs. I don’t have any friends, I have barely been going to school lately, I have no hobbies and don’t like any activities.

I’ve also been having some suicidal thoughts,   I can’t think of anything in my future that makes me want to live. I don’t see my self becoming any happier, if I think about my future, no possible life sounds like something I want to live. There’s no jobs that sound appealing, I have really bad social anxiety and don’t like being with anyone, so I probably won’t have any friends or relationship or family.

The only things keeping me alive right now are drugs and the fact that I don’t know what death will be like.

PS: I’m a 15(16 in a few days) year old male, about 75-80kg, 184cm. I’ve been diagnosed with ADHD and I have been in treatment for depression and social anxiety disorder (I don’t think I’ve been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder yet, but I’m about 100% certain I have it since I have every pretty much every symptom and match the exact description.)

Edit: Here’s just a bit of a rant I wanted to add:

Everyone always says: “it will all get better” and it annoys me so much, even my therapist says it all the time. But who says it will? They don’t know if it will ever get better. They also tell me that therapy will always fix everything but that also isn’t even true. There’s no evidence that all depression (or for me social anxiety as well) can always be cured. It’s just bullshit to make me feel better but it doesn’t, it just makes me feel like shit. It makes me think that there’s something wrong with me and that I’m the reason it doesn’t get better and that there’s something specifically wrong with me. I wish people would just stop lying to me and tell me the truth: that not everything can be fixed with therapy and medication. Some people will just feel like shit for the rest of their lives and I’m probably one of them, so why would I even want to live that life?",1,0,0,"pretty much lost hope first got prescribed ssri sertraline back december , depression social anxiety.i started 25mg day , think month got 50mg week ago 100mg . think done anything meor least significant enough notice . got side effects benefits yet . heard could take time reduce depression , point pretty much lost hope . also therapy almost year mental state seems gotten worse . even relapsed days ago , clean half year.poly substance addiction therapy medicine seem helped , far unfortunately things actually helped drugs . friends , barely going school lately , hobbies like activities . also suicidal thoughts , think anything future makes want live . see self becoming happier , think future , possible life sounds like something want live . jobs sound appealing , really bad social anxiety like anyone , probably friends relationship family . things keeping alive right drugs fact know death like . ps 1516 days year old male , 7580kg , 184cm . diagnosed adhd treatment depression social anxiety disorder think diagnosed social anxiety disorder yet , 100 certain since every pretty much every symptom match exact description . edit bit rant wanted add everyone always says get better annoys much , even therapist says time . says ? know ever get better . also tell therapy always fix everything also even true . evidence depression social anxiety well always cured . bullshit make feel better , makes feel like shit . makes think something wrong reason get better something specifically wrong . wish people would stop lying tell truth everything fixed therapy medication . people feel like shit rest lives probably one , would even want live life ?"

1jdlocm,1742240384.0,"I’ve had a really, really hard time lately. Need support. To give you some short background of my life, I have had a severe panic/anxiety disorder since I was 13. I am 23 now. It’s affected my life in large ways. I was always over emotional, especially as a teenager, so I’ve never had a whole lot of friends, and a lot of the close friends I’ve had are no longer my friends due to petty drama.

Plus, there’s my romantic relationship past. That’s extremely messy. I’ve kept friends with some of my ex’s over the years because we ended on good terms, but a lot of the breakups with my ex’s were extremely messy, sometimes due to my overly-emotional nature. 

Lastly, for the past 2 years I’ve been going through severe depression on/off. During this time I’ve made some really bad decisions and hurt some people emotionally. 

I can’t help but feeling like there’s no coming back from all this, like I’m a broken person with a broken past who hurts people and can’t be fixed. The ironic thing is, I’ve never wanted to hurt anybody. I’m extremely kind natured and everything that’s happened feels so against who I am inside. But nobody can see that side of me when all they see is a mess.

I know not everyone hates me, but some days, it’s hard not to feel that way. I feel constantly misunderstood and unfixable. Add this to my panic disorder and it’s all one big screwed up stupid ass mess. 

I just need some support, I guess. People who know what I’m going through. The past few days I’ve been having a bit of a breakdown because after not having a fight with anyone in a whole year, I had a fight with someone I had just become friends with over something I completely misinterpreted.

My past and the depression took everything from me. My childhood was a living hell, during school and now in worklife i always get bullied. I always end up with abusive boyfriends (one of them r\*ped me). Friends always backstabbed or betrayed me.

I'm now at a point, where i don't trust anyone. I'm just so done with life and other humans. I cut ties to my family and the couple ""friends"" i still had. I just couldn't take it any longer.

I'm all alone now. I know this is not healthy and the right thing. But how do you continue? I always try and try and try...am hopeful. But it always ends up in failure.

I also tried a lot of therapies, but i don't believe in it any more. I focus on my medication, so that i can function and handle my life.

1jcruih,1742149071.0,"I have the ""wrong"" type of depression SSRIs didn't do shit. Nor mirtazapine. Nor CBT. Nor counselling. Nor even stimulants now.

I genuinely despise the words ""attitude"" and ""mindset"" and wish to see them permanently expunged from the English vocabulary. Incidentally, none of the counsellors or therapists I've seen over the years have used those two words with me. It's only people who explicitly *aren't* healthcare professionals who say those words within my earshot. I wonder why that is.

I legitimately wonder if I have a neurological disorder that better explains why I'm so passive and avoidant, because others who apparently have depression seemingly do not understand, at least not anymore. Not that I'd expect to be taken seriously by healthcare professionals if I were to ask.

I guess I'm not the relatively acceptable type of depressed where I'm ""resilient"" enough or whatever to still take care of myself and live independently. ""Okay, *I* am depressed, *I* hate myself, but at least I brush my teeth/go outside/drink water/eat actual meals, you have no excuse"" - okay, congratulations. Cool. I don't know what you expect me to do with this information. Hearing it has increased the concentrations of dopamine, serotonin, and whatever ""willpower"" is in my brain by an astounding 0.000000000%. It may well have further depleted them, if anything.

Then there's the idea that if I ""hit rock bottom"" I'll magically improve because I ""have to."" I doubt it. If I were on the brink of homelessness, that wouldn't magically make me employable, or make me successfully get a job. I'd just be homeless. It doesn't work out for everyone like that. Just world fallacy, and so on.

I can understand how the always living have been deluded into thinking that we ""want"" or ""choose"" to be the way. But I genuinely do not understand how people more functional than me, who claim to have once been as nonfunctional as me, who apparently have/had depression, also delude themselves into thinking that those who didn't survive with them, who didn't get to go with them, only didn't do so because they ""chose"" or ""wanted"" to stay behind.

Explain to me why I would ""choose"" this and how exactly I benefit from feeling as though my hair is composed of straw and my brain holds seemingly as much value as a raisin.

Hey! Since my therapist isn't there for a while I thought I'd try it here and maybe I get something useful out of it.

My depression is pretty life-changing, I still have ambitions, but no way of achieving them. There's so much I want to do: Learn HTML, start a sport, go for a run more, have better hygiene, get better at skincare stuff and cooking, learning how to draw on my own and learn Spanish. 

Here's the deal though: I can't. Let's look at yesterday to explain why. Yesterday was Sunday. My to-do's were write 2 e-mails (around 2mins each) do some cleaning (30mins max.) and go for a walk to the nearby park (around 50mins back and forth). That's not even 1.5h of my day. I didn't even expect myself to study for school or shower, which I really should do. Still, I didn't manage to do all of it and just did the bare minimum and left out the walk.

You might have immediately drawn a conclusion that took me years to reach: It isn't about time. It's about energy. I simply have around 20% of the energy the average person has. And believe me, I tried to change this: Sleep this, medication that, do more of what you want to do, yada yada. I'm simply too tired and depressed. 

Before you suggest it: I have been checked. I do regular blood tests and had my hormones tested etc. I sleep a lot but that's already been an issue my late mother had so it lies in the family and there's no medical reason to be found.

  
If I want to do any of the things listed above, I'd need to compromise on the necessary things I NEED to do, such as school, more than I already do. I'm so tired of cutting every corner and still feeling like collapsing every minute of every day. 

I know I might sound ungrateful, but I don't want to hear ""just do 5mins of X every day instead of an hour"". Some smart guy once said something I haven't forgotten since: ""A man who does not have 2/3 of a day to himself is a slave"" which is accurate. And I'd like to think 5mins a day of things I actively want to do (not bedrotting, but actually doing stuff) is too little to not make me a slave.

I am unable to function to do things and have zero to almost no energy at all every day, as well dissociating and sleeping each day.

She dislikes that, she doesn’t like it very much so and that’s alright, I don’t expect her to do.

I just wish she wouldn’t make me confused really, depression has taken a toll on me my whole life and she complains if I don’t get better. She pushes me to therapy, and takes me out and repeats that process again expecting a good outcome of it.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m trying, really. I’m heavily suicidal and depressed and have absolutely no idea what I’m doing anymore!!!!!!!! I am shame. Shame and shame.

Depression is an interesting thing, on how not only changes you, but the people around you. 

I am insufficient and insufferable, it’s absolutely saddening. Pitiful. Perchance!

Then again I could be dramatic in all terms, ASD does a funny thing to your brain and all. 

Dissociation also doing more funny things.

I mean, I found out four or five months ago I been dissociating all my life and am unable to remember things at all, nothing of my life and only things that are repeated every day.

Life is interesting, but I can’t help but wait for the fuse to just lighten up and blow. 

Props, or wishes for people who suffer from depression, I fear— or feel that we are people who only understand each other because we go through it rough.

Everyone is so… brave? strong? I mean some of us do not have options, we are depressed but not strong, we live.. because we don’t exactly like death. Opposite to those who wish for death.

Then again, depression affects everyone in mysterious ways.

Today is the future and tomorrow is the present, I hope that between it, my death will burst because I solely, cannot live anymore with such struggles like this.

1jd95hq,1742206048.0,"I'm Tired I've been told that it gets better, but I've been depressed since I was 13, and 11 years later, it doesn't seem to be looking up for me.

It's like, a bunch of different things are weighing down on my shoulders right now. On one hand, it feels like my parents want me to achieve more and more, and I understand it. And then, I see their friends' kids achieving those kinds of things, and I know that success is relative, but I'm plagued by how inadequate I am, and then, I remember things from my childhood that I'm better off forgetting. I remember all those times I was yelled at, and all those times my extended family said something hurtful, so, it feels like I keep picking at scabs without giving them time to heal.

Then it boils down to the question: do I deserve to heal? Do I deserve to be happy? Can I be happy knowing that everything comes back to money? It's money, money, and money, and I don't know. I don't know anymore.

I think I just loathe myself so much that I'd rather picture me dying than a future where things work out, because how dare I hope? Am I allowed to hope? But if I hope and things don't work out, I'll be disappointed. And it's just hell in my mind. There's no peace.

The only times I can forget everything are when I pray, talk to my friends or when I read my favorite novel, but even in those times, there's this sinking feeling of ""What if everyone hates me? What if the people I love actually hate me?"" It's a disservice to them that I have those thoughts in the first place. I know I'm loved. I know. But it's like I keep defaulting to thinking that way. 

And it literally feels like hell because even if I achieve something, I'm grateful and thankful, and I celebrate it for an hour, but then I just. Go back to thinking that the world would be better off without me. I don't know. It feels like my cross to bear, so I'll bear it, but I wish I didn't hate myself so much? I wish I wasn't a burden. I wish I could sleep without feeling paranoid and guilty. I wish I could just have some peace mentally.

I see how hard my mom works to fund my education, and I feel bad for having fun. When my dad yells at me, I just dissociate, but I spend most of my time on pins and needles, wondering when the next lecture/scolding will come.

I just can't seem to love myself. I just want to break down and cry but I can only do it in secret. I know I should just die, but I have responsibilities, so I can't go yet. It's just so tiring, and it's worse because no one knows. I can't tell my parents. I can only tell the friends I've made online, but I don't want to bother them with these heavy emotions either.

1jd1m88,1742175909.0,"i try to get better and things only continue to get worse hello everyone. just made a throwaway account to vent. i am a 19 yr old transgender female and im going through a very rough time right now. i am very fortunate to have many people in my life who legitimately love and support me at a deep level, but they cannot really help me with where I'm at mentally at the moment.  
my family has very mixed feelings on my gender identity. my mom supports me, my dad does not but does not actively want to disown me over it. however, i am reliant on my father to help me pay for university so i cannot even consider hrt/anything lasting. even before i came out as trans, my family and i have always had a slightly tenuous relationship. my parents are divorced and my mom and dad both have their own share of unresolved mental issues that they kind of just involuntarily forced me to try to help them with to a certain extent. my mom especially since i primarily lived with her basically tried to force me to be her best friend, socially stunting me greatly as a result.

the last time i was truly depressed was when I was 11 and had a severe case of suicidal ideation. i have worked incredibly hard to try to get to a point where i can function decently. i am in my fourth semester of university as a bioinformatics major and have managed a 4.0 thus far in my studies and many of my professors think highly of me. im involved in research and a few extracurriculars and i think im generally liked by the people that i have come across in both realms. however, recently i've been cracking a little bit. imposter syndrome has been making me feel like my friends and colleagues are incorrectly perceiving me and my abilities and as i look for internships and increasingly find things unfunded in the current political climate, i feel negatively about my ability to make a career out of myself in the sciences.

i also have been struggling a lot with wanting to get into certain hobbies but feeling incredibly discouraged by adversity i encounter when trying to pursue them. most of my closest friends are deeply creative people in one or more ways and i want to find a genuine outlet(s) for me as well. i have a lot of ideas, but i wonder if my mind is fundamentally incapable of doing anything that isn't strictly academic-brained. i never find myself inclined to any one hobby and as a result they all appear as if they're 'not for me'.

i was already feeling like i might be depressed again. the prospect of having to deal with that made me incredibly upset and it has made me distance myself from my friends and allies a lot. i don't want to burden them with my emotions. 

the true moment that broke me came last night. i went home with one of my closest friends for spring break and we had an absolutely lovely time. while driving back to uni, i got my first ever speeding ticket and the cop was an asshole to me for my appearance + intimidated me in general. it was bad but speeding tickets happen. i was then driving under the speed limit when not 10 minutes later i was involved in a deer collision. my friend and i were ok and the car was drivable enough to make it back to my uni but i have no idea whether the car is totaled or not. im entirely at the mercy of my insurance (thankfully i have comprehensive coverage) as to whether my car is able to be repaired or not and the cost of the tickets + increased insurance premiums rests entirely on me. as traumatic as that night was, in combination with everything else, i feel entirely broken. im grateful that i survived, mostly for my friend's sake, but with how dire everything in my life is going outside of my friendships i wonder if it would've been a less cruel fate for the deer to take me out. 

im going to try to go to class tomorrow but i just feel so alone. i have a consult that i scheduled prior to spring break with my uni counseling center on tuesday and hopefully that can help. i just feel like my options are screwed now. my car was a lifesaver for me in feeling like i had power and control over my life outside of my family and it symbolized at the very least an escape for me if things got dire. now im entirely at the mercy of the world. im fucking screwed.",3,0,0,"try get better things continue get worse hello everyone . made throwaway account vent . 19 yr old transgender female going rough time right . fortunate many people life legitimately love support deep level , really help mentally moment . family mixed feelings gender identity . mom supports , dad actively want disown . however , reliant father help pay university even consider hrtanything lasting . even came trans , family always slightly tenuous relationship . parents divorced mom dad share unresolved mental issues kind involuntarily forced try help certain extent . mom especially since primarily lived basically tried force best friend , socially stunting greatly result . last time truly depressed 11 severe case suicidal ideation . worked incredibly hard try get point function decently . fourth semester university bioinformatics major managed 4.0 thus far studies many professors think highly . involved research extracurriculars think generally liked people come across realms . however , recently cracking little bit . imposter syndrome making feel like friends colleagues incorrectly perceiving abilities look internships increasingly find things unfunded current political climate , feel negatively ability make career sciences . also struggling lot wanting get certain hobbies feeling incredibly discouraged adversity encounter trying pursue . closest friends deeply creative people one ways want find genuine outlets well . lot ideas , wonder mind fundamentally incapable anything strictly academicbrained . never find inclined one hobby result appear . already feeling like might depressed . prospect deal made incredibly upset made distance friends allies lot . want burden emotions . true moment broke came last night . went home one closest friends spring break absolutely lovely time . driving back uni , got first ever speeding ticket cop asshole appearance intimidated general . bad speeding tickets happen . driving speed limit 10 minutes later involved deer collision . friend ok car drivable enough make back uni idea whether car totaled . entirely mercy insurance thankfully comprehensive coverage whether car able repaired cost tickets increased insurance premiums rests entirely . traumatic night , combination everything else , feel entirely broken . grateful survived , mostly friends sake , dire everything life going outside friendships wonder would less cruel fate deer take . going try go class tomorrow feel alone . consult scheduled prior spring break uni counseling center tuesday hopefully help . feel like options screwed . car lifesaver feeling like power control life outside family symbolized least escape things got dire . entirely mercy world . fucking screwed ."
cz6nfd,1567525791.0,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Several days ago, I had an intense depressive episode that I struggle to talk and think properly, intense hyperventilation, body so heavy and could barely move an inch (even if I ate very little the past weeks), and as I fell on the floor and laid there for what felt like two haunting hours…. I almost killed myself again…


I laid in a side position (where my shoulder crush my chest) while the snots coated both my mouth and nostrils…. Basically I struggle to breathe and I can’t seek help or change position to save myself. I was suffocated. And all those two hours, all I could think of was this inner monologue:


“Is this how I’ll die? Last memory was me suffering from a depressive episode, last meal was instant noodles,  last conversations I had with everyone was a fight because everyone struggle to understand bipolar symptoms, everyone’s disappointed (including myself) on how I couldn’t function normally after the diagnosis. I imagine how my funeral would be, how would my sisters feel? Would my friends show up? Would anyone care? Would anyone grief? Have I done enough for people to care? For anyone to finally have the humanity and strength to end generational trauma and abuse…. Something that I couldn’t do myself…. 


I’m sorry if I’m not strong enough to save any victim that might go through the same hell as me. Sorry if I haven’t fully shared my side of the story… which might save anyone with suicidal ideations. I’m sorry if I’m too selfish to care anymore if my death will hurt you. I just cant afford to wake up because the “idea of being alive” is the SLOWEST FORM OF DEATH I could imagine. I’m sorry if I can’t afford to have hope. I’m sorry if there wasn’t any closure or silver lining to this…. I’m a 24 female, daughter of immigrant parents and a promising artist/designer, and yet recent years has shown that my health is getting worse… Im not as smart or productive as I use to be…. It’s like I slowly lost all of my abilities. I look in the mirror and as I stare in my eyes… I don’t see myself or any form of life left… and the worst part… no one notices…


So sadly, this is my last memory… nothing but grim and lonesome… loved by no one”

at this point, i'm convinced that i'm not who i used to be before the start of 8th grade hit me like that one bus did to regina george or something- its kinda like when you tear a piece of paper, you can tape it or staple it together for all i care, and in a way, it does attend to the problem, yet the piece of paper is permanently changed, irreversibly damaged. i've managed to convince myself that emotions are irrelevant and only serve as mere obstacles to one's goals, yet if i acted the part, everyone would start freaking out and going nuts on how the expressive, enthusiastic kid with the heart of gold is now so insanely stoic, so unfeeling and so soulless. it's not that i'm completely empty nor faking the entirety of my personality, i just feel extremely numb. i feel obligated to act consistently the same every day so that people won't see what's wrong, so that they won't inquire of my mental state, and it would be unnecessary for me to open up. that in itself, could avoid the reason i'm so hopelessly unwelcoming to the thought of my own feelings.

which leads me to vent about this specific person whose actions completely trashed my thirteenth birthday. i honestly don't get how my perspective of him was delayed by so much, by half a decade. i guess, i only saw what i wanted to see in him- the qualities that made me almost feel inferior. it's daunting how so much can change in five years, that the once cheerful, enthusiastic and upbeat little ray of sunshine who never failed to amuse his friends, has turned into this cocky, arrogant, game-addicted coward with a superiority complex. that little girl with the twin braids who used to always share her candy and her secrets for the sake of keeping conversation with you? everyone’s there for the chronicles of her life so far, never how she felt during the story took place. i know i said i should really leave him in the past and forget our friendship ever existed, but was everything i did in vain, six years of camaraderie destined to be forgotten and neglected at the “end” of the road anyway? like, is that all? disappointing. my rationality is nagging at me to just let him go, but my conscience is stubborn about continuing to wait for him; to seize the next opportunity to get him back; so stubborn, in fact, that its seemingly bound to happen. however, it’s hopeless. as much as getting him to talk to me is possible, making amends and reuniting with him is a completely irrelevant matter. and, it’s even more ironic that at this point, that i’m expected to act as if i despise him with every fiber of my very being because it’s apparently “his loss”. while it’s true that i do resent him for what happened, in truth, it’s painfully difficult to just.. hate someone you’ve loved for three years. besides, “his loss” but how come i’m the one suffering here in silence? if i vent to someone, i’d be overwhelmed with the thought that i’m seeking attention. that i’m doing this for pity.

this whole ordeal has traumatized me so much, that it’s been more than half a year since i’ve loved someone. it’s hard for me to love even my own kin or my closest friends, because i’m extremely paranoid about them cowering away from me after i start warming up to them, and when it’s obvious i love them. my situation right now is comparable to having an invisible barrier keeping everyone away from me, yet close enough for them to start loving me. it’s like i haven’t hardened myself enough to let daniel go, yet if i do so any further, i’d start pushing my friends away.

i’ve met a lot of people on this journey of falling into the rabbit hole of torturing myself about the “incident” and turning a blind eye to it. especially this one short boy, my seatmate in maths class. he’s a year younger than the rest of our grade. we used to do outlandish things to entertain ourselves in an 80-minute long period, yet now all he ever talks about is his ex-best friend who’s also a friend of mine. he’s getting extremely comfortable with me, too comfortable, and it strikes a nerve. in fact, if i were to put it in harsher wording, he disgusts me. i’ve heard that he’s trying to “match my freak”, yet the only thing he’s doing is making me question if i’m this annoying. he makes everything a reference to taylor swift, and even attempts to make sexual jokes about me, oblivious to how far he’s going with his jokes and questions. he wants to try his hand at my style of friendly banter, unaware that he was basically just offending me more and more with each advance he makes. he’s even attempted multiple times to embarrass me in front of the male lead of the “incident” for the shits and giggles, and has to have it worse because his former best friend is better than him and he’s jealous. the funniest part is, he’s been rumored to have feelings for me by many of our mutual friends, and has even confirmed it to priscilla, the girl i’m always seen with. it’s like he’s desperate for me to know. he keeps dropping cryptic messages about liking an extroverted girl who acts like a guy and swears a shit ton, yet refuses to elaborate. why even bother start the conversation about “her” if you aren’t going to tell me about her? i swear, every single conversation we have either revolves around how he’s desperate for a girlfriend, how he still detests his ex best friend or how obsessed he is with an overrated singer i won’t name. talking to a blank wall is more interesting than talking to him, because it’s like he’s mentally (or vertically, in that matter) challenged to not talk about these three topics for five minutes. originally, i’ve contemplated actually giving him a shot at dating me under the condition that we make it official two years later even if i can’t love him, yet now he gives me the ick, and i’d rather date my cat. i guess daniel was right when he slowly drifted away from me, because if even an ambitious person like me gave up, there’s no way this kid wouldn’t. because of this kid i’m currently fussing about, i now understand how daniel felt last july when i confessed. maybe, this is what him and i have in common, being annoyed by the person that likes us, yet we don’t exactly hate them. i don’t blame him anymore. 

i don’t care anymore. my grades, my interpersonal relationships or my love life can go screw themselves in a ditch for all i care. in fact, there’s practically nothing you can do to make me care, because emotions are irrelevant. they are mere obstacles to what you’re endeavoring to do. truth be told, i’m exhausted of life. it’s the fact that i don’t want to be the dead friend that’s holding me back. i wish i could one day say “fuck you all, i’m out of here,” and disappear into the abyss. imagine missing out on the events taking place in your friend group who you introduced to each other, the core member of the group gone for eternity.",3,2,0,"idc young feel way anymore far , lifes chaotic shitstorm even spontaneous person like keep one day , crush starting despise , day , guy best friend tries match freak reality excruciatingly annoying wants screw . point , convinced used start 8th grade hit like one bus regina george something kind like tear piece paper , tape staple together care , way , attend problem , yet piece paper permanently changed , irreversibly damaged . managed convince emotions irrelevant serve mere obstacles ones goals , yet acted part , everyone would start freaking going nuts expressive , enthusiastic kid heart gold insanely stoic , unfeeling soulless . completely empty faking entirety personality , feel extremely numb . feel obligated act consistently every day people see wrong , inquire mental state , would unnecessary open . , could avoid reason hopelessly unwelcoming thought feelings . leads vent specific person whose actions completely trashed thirteenth birthday . honestly get perspective delayed much , half decade . guess , saw wanted see qualities made almost feel inferior . daunting much change five years , cheerful , enthusiastic upbeat little ray sunshine never failed amuse friends , turned cocky , arrogant , gameaddicted coward superiority complex . little girl twin braids used always share candy secrets sake keeping conversation ?

1jgjgr7,1742570842.0,"Rules implemented by CPS creating suicidal ideation I went into foster care at the start of this year and child protection have implemented rules that heavily restrict me from seeing my horse. From what I know it’s because I would obsess over my horses. 

I’ve owned my horse for a year and a half and he helped me through so much, I would be dead right now if it wasn’t for him.

I would spend so much time with him, like 12hrs everyday Monday-Sunday (I haven’t really attended school since 2020), I saw my horse more than I would my own family. 
He’s had multiple health issues throughout my ownership of him and because of that I became very overprotective of him. 

I know it’s my own fault that I can’t see him but I’m still not coping well at all. I’ve started to struggle with my eating and self harm again, as well as suicidal thoughts surrounding this situation. 

Horses are so so important to me and it feels like I’ve lost them. They’ve been my special interest since at least 2018 and I’d been begging my parents for even longer to let me get one. All of my future plans, and dream careers surrounded horses.

My guardian said she’ll mention it to my case manager again soon but to not get my hopes up. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve done pretty much everything CPS want me to do.

1jgawk0,1742540339.0,"Not much misery, not much happiness Honestly if this isn't the right place to put this, just ban my dumb ass. 

I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care to live much longer. I don't have a bad life. In terms of most of the planet, I'm actually pretty well off. Children in India, China, or Africa would kill to be me. 

And yet, I find that I despise my body, I hate my past, and I no longer find happiness in anything I do. Ever since I hit puberty, I've had suicidal thoughts, and therapy or not, for a full decade now I've considered suicide nearly every single day. 

And it's not even much to do with misery, so much to do with lack of happiness. I simply can't fucking be happy with what I have. I started a gratitude journal specifically to try to combat this stuff, long before I tried therapy. Even now, at the point where I have completed higher education, started research, contributed to cancer treatment research, all the things that brought me hope as a child, and yet as much as I'm proud of the effort I put in, I realize that the one person who never benefitted from it was me. If I wasn't currently working in science, I would have already caught the bus. Turns out starvation, sleep deprivation, and dehydration CAN be worked through, but the severe headaches, boredom, and shits will catch up with you around a week in.  
  
 I spent so much time trying to help other people, and now that my body is prematurely failing me, I find myself thinking that I've probably done enough. The only reason I'm not already gone is sentimentality for a disabled younger sister, and even then, I'm wondering if I could just convince my relatives to just not tell her. It would probably work until she dies, the poor girl. I once sat down and quantified my reasons to live, and the things I didn't like, just to see if it made any sense from that perspective. Turns out, according to the things I value in life, I'm just barely living a life that isn't worth living. Worse, when I estimated how things were likely to be in the future, no matter how many different options I considered, simply as a matter of how my body will continue to change, how my career will go, etc, the expected utility of continuing to live is pretty negative. From any perspective I've been able to take, the smart thing to do has been to just end it before things get worse, and the only reason I haven't is because I'm a coward who has to test things out different ways first before trying out the obvious way he knows will work well enough.

Everything in my life is confusing. I just don't know what I want or how anything works. I feel so stupid but I can't understand basic human emotions either. Half the time I don't even know what I'm supposed to say in so many situations so I either overexplain or do nothing at all. Neither of these have ever worked out for me. I'm in my late teens and I honestly don't have a single idea of what I'm doing.

I have so many emotions left unpacked I don't know how to deal with any of it. I can't get any professional help and my family is no better..

I feel like none of my 'friends' actually want to spend time with me or talk to me and I feel like a massive fucking burden. Every thing about me is fucked entirely. I don't have passion for anything and nothing makes me feel happy anymore.. I thought I would finally be able to live with myself for the slightest amount of time because I actually felt happy figuring out myself and my identity. I figured I was trans and that just came with so many more problems.. Not entirely related but my girlfriend also just decided go to no contact with me. well over a month ago. I can't go anything about it and now I guess she's my ex but I've gotten no fucking closure I don't understand anything.. I tried to communicate so many times, she always agreed but then undermined everything and kept ignoring me and now she's entirely gone.

There's nothing I can do about it. I don't think anyone deserves someone so unsure of themselves and this suicidal but all I want is a proper conversation. All my life I've apologised and now I just want one back. I don't know how to deal with any of my mental issues. My studies are fucked and so is my economic state. The country I'm from is also entirely insane and I don't have a way of leaving. We have such shitty people here it's unreal and the education system doesn't help. Nor is it LGBT friendly in the slightest. I hear slurs everywhere I fucking go... I can't stand it anymore.. There's so many underlying issues and I don't have the explainations to anything. My own BROTHER raped me when I was 13 and there was nothing I could do. My parents SAW US. They got him off me yet I was instantly instructed not to tell a single soul because it was a fucking. family. matter.

1jg7kjp,1742527369.0,"Become A Vagabond Instead? I've been suicidal for a few years and ""attempted"" to overdose on tylenol in 2023. But from that experience I realized how cowardly I am and all this time I regret telling my mother that I did it since I didn't even suffer long term damage. I thought i hit rock bottom before but now I'm really here. No money. Few friends if any, and a strong urge to not keep playing this dumb game. 

I've been lurking the vagabond subreddit and as tough as the lifestyle can be, I feel like I need it. Just run away and meet strangers, no commitments except for making sure I eat and sleep. I figure if I die on the streets at least I got some cool experiences and got to escape. If I hate it I could just hitchhike somewhere with a large enough bridge. Advice I've recieved in the past and parroted myself to other is ""if you want to die, maybe try things you've always wanted to do but were to scared to."" Because obviously if you wanted to skydive but were worried about dying, whats the issue now? Thats my headspace. 

Im rambling. Im just really stressed out because I plan on joining a conservation corp that offers lodging and great pay for my state, but that won't be until the end of the year. I'll probably hate it but it gets me out of the house, gives me money, and they'll give me my diploma and some other certs. Until then Im stuck at home 24/7 with my bills paid by my younger sibling and mother. Fucking blows.

Hypothetically, I can sell some of my stuff for cash to get started then live off begging or learn how to forage with other vagabonds.

1jgcyu8,1742549872.0,"my best friend and partner in life said goodbye today and I dont know how to help her shes been through it, so much trauma as a child and as an adult.  she justifies what people do to her as they must have really needed it.

shes been diagnosed schizoaffective, has been in and out of psychosis, drug use doesnt help but she thinks it makes her happy for a little bit even though as her friend i know its very much the opposite. 

shes been hanging on, and thats all i could ask for

  
the past few years shes been in and out of psych wards, its a game, she litterally has to beat the tests so she can go home  because of this she has recently started pushing back even when she brings up needing to go because she is just going to play the game and not leave with anything worth being there for.  

her mother and I dont see eye to eye, but we both understand that we dont get along because we show love differently, but we both underrstand that we are both genuinely trying to be helpful and we make a great team when we have to work together.  

right after christmas my friend was living with me 800 miles away from her mom, and doing good. she was trying to get her mental health in order and entered a recovery that she was truly embracing, then her mom convinced her to come to a rehab near her house, and while driving her down convinced her she didnt need to, and then they started doing fentanyl. 

she came up here about a month ago and detoxed completely and was doing good. her mom convinced her to leave again, and she decided to travel to find her suicide

  
I watched her introduce herself a few days ago to an incredibly sketchy homeless person as ""lets go adventure, my mom will pay for everything"" 

that was monday, she has since given her car and everything she owns to this guy and convinced him to basically get her so bad she dies, 

  
she didnt say this specifically because she was looking for someone to dominate and abuse her so that she couldnt back out or be scared of the suicide shes been craving but unable to complete on her own.  he doesnt let her talk on the phone without supervision, and if she starts saying anything of substance he shuts it down and hangs up the phone. 

they swung by my house earlier today to pick up some art supplies she had here, and we have an absolutely amazing relationship and ability to communicate with each other. she told me everything that was happening by crafting experiences with him over the past few days that I would recognize from one of or both of our lives and be able to hear a narrative she couldnt say in front of him. he litterally bought me pizza and then made us sit on the porch while he sat in the car smoking and monitori what she was saying. he didnt even let her go in her own bedroom to get her art bag, he made me grab it for her 

  
so basically she is in full blown psychosis, telling me its worse than the worst i have ever seen her, and i can agree.  she was in an incredibly bad headspace. sang a song about him helping her die, which he made an awkward negative remark about because he didnt realize she told me thats what was happening right before she started singing.  

she made some referances I would catch to make sure that I was aware that he is aware that she is in full blown psychosis, and that he has no intention of nurturing that, or doing anything but using that for gains.  

  
so shes been trying to tell me she fucked up, and that she knows shes in a bad place, and that she gave him the car, those are all things that got repremanded and her phone turned off.  shes not allolwed to be alone, or to talk to anyone unatended, but she is technically there on her own free will so i dont know how to get her out.. 

  
I'm going to talk to her dad first because our relationship is great, he is like a dad to me too, and I absolutely love this man, and then I have to call her mom later. I want them to know whats going on, and I feel like she unloaded brutal honesty on her family before she left 2 weeks ago so they wouldnt be surprised, and so i wouldnt have to feel like i could betray her confidence because shes been an open book, I have to tell them to be careful what they say to her and all that, but what conversation do I have with her mom about how to save her? 

shes voluntarily being held, fed drugs and abused with the intention of dying.  she made a big deal about the art supplies today because shes in a hurry, I really dont know what to do, and at this point i feel like detox in a jail cell is the only thing she will fail at enough times to cycle through courts until she basically gets soi tired of jail and court she just does it, and thats a concept shes discussed. before the fentanyl this year shes done drugs and had mental health issues but never really physical addiction..

  
i dont know how to help and I dont know what to tell her parents,  but the effort shes put in the past few days to make sure I understand exactly what is happening right now without him knowing she said anything about what shes been up to makes me feel like she really wants the help.  

  
I know a commitment in my state is either self appointed or a weekly court deal where you are in the hospital until your doctors and your judge agree you are no longer in need of treatment, so if we can figure out how to get law enforcement to notice she needs crisis care she cant AMA her way out here, but I have no idea how to get her to that point.  we're all losing communication, and its usually one word non answers that make no sense or something that she gets yelled at for and the phone call terminated, I know I dont get location updates anymore, Im assuming her family doesnt either.

  
i havent slept, I've been crying and membering the goods and the bads, and trying to come up with what to say to her parents, and how to not break down during those calls. 

  
if anyone managed to read my stressed out word vomit and can give me any pointers, resources, literally anything i even might be able to flesh out into an idea or hope. or just ways to organize my thoughts to talk to her parents without sounding as hopeless and stressed out and scared as I am

1jg7z18,1742528712.0,"What is this? Hello, I’m a woman who’s been diagnosed with depression for just about two years now, and nothing has gotten better. For all this time and even much time before, I couldn’t do anything until peer pressure or my self-hatred has totaled me. I follow the clock, doing just enough to seem normal. I can care about my hygiene and do most of the worksheets due in academics. I can’t be myself; there is no self, and no social sphere stays in shape. I learned what a normal convo sounds like, what a normal person acts like, and what is considered okay and not. I even add to future goals or plans. And even when the regular play doesn’t work, I make it all a joke and a story everyone wants to hear. I’m just a ghost, perfect enough to blend in. I’m done

Yes, I’ve gotten better at acting. Yes, I’ve become better at hiding. Yes, I have erased any emotion I can’t use to harm myself. Yes, I am nothing.

Now, I don’t even know what this is anymore. I continue to follow the clock, but my brain creates these elaborate plans to give me what I deserve; I devour their taste, but when I have to chew, it’s never right. I open the day dressing to my best, for if I am this horrid on the inside, maybe I can make the blubber appealing. I do the tasks handed in during the babysitter's service called education. I add on to hide from the place that contains me. Then, when the time comes, all I do is eat. Then, sleep and think. Think about how I could act, how this should end, how awful this has become. I am constantly stuck in the most torturous of normality. I'm stuck smiling, stuck hanging out with my abusers, stuck breathing. 

I continue breathing, but what is this? I have no motivation, but I can make my grades look good. I have no energy, but I can scroll and scroll. I have no emotion but can feel and see the biggest downfall. I have dreams, but I forget the ongoing seconds will always be worse than any amount of blood. I am not human; I will do anything to ruin myself. Sometimes, I’ll go time not sleeping, seeing what will happen; sometimes, I’ll see how long I can go without eating; sometimes…

Am I going insane? But I’m not hallucinating. Am I depressed? But this is nothing and everything like two years ago. Am I a teenager? Teenagers struggle all the time; you think you’re unique. Is it knowledge? One is informed of the horrors of humanity, but they get power and money, but their actions cause the life of the average person to fall. What is this?

I am an infj, wanderlust, simple creature-like individual incapable of finding anything worth a damn. Tried finding all kinds of jobs and researching into all kinds of careers and places and I haven't found a single one. To see through all of the bullshit and yet to have nothing to show for it, as a certain character from Dostoyevsky's work pointed out. Might as well build a monument to a void. I tried different career aptitude tests and all it comes up with is artistic careers. Writer. Author. Musician. Painter. Director. I like to write, and have written many short stories and poems and even a novel. But unfortunately the world as it is today would gladly see one die homeless and under a bridge, like an old acquaintance I knew. He was a homeless man, who also had to ration his insulin medication. At least until he no longer could. And so too would be my fate if I did that too. Godless, heartless, aimless. That's all I've seen from visiting different cities and locations. Just different congregations of human beings who, while they may differ in their vernacular, ultimately exhibit the same signs of a suicidal foregone conclusion. Doesn't matter the talent or the ability, if it doesn't stimulate a neoliberal's fetish for capitalism, you might as well die. And so I wonder, if I know the ending, why not skip to the end?

To be honest I'm just waiting until I can no longer afford rent, by which point I'll be taking an early stage exit with the assistance of my good friend Mossberg.

If my melancholic and depression fueled stupor is not making any sense, allow me to say this. What careers have you found that actually address this sort of ontological incompatibly?

I am very clear for my want of help, they don't take me seriously, my friends are all like ""nuh uh not yet we gotta move out together as bros"", I don't care about the future, because I won't have one and I don't want one, I've lost the point of life.

1jg68mj,1742523126.0,"Starting to feel disgusted just looking at myself. Feeling useless. I'm (31MtF) a suicide survivor who has lived through three attempts in my 31 years on earth. I've been medicated for a few years now and used to go to therapy but haven't since we moved recently.

My partner and I have been together for 3 years now. We live together and things are fine. Stressful, since living with family, but fine. Our relationship is healthy and we are both happy in it. I hang out with a friend group somewhat daily I've had for years and we all play games together. 

I haven't had suicidal thoughts in years but tonight they're back. I don't know why. I have this overwhelming feeling of loneliness despite having good people in my life who care about me. I feel empty and unfulfilled with my position in life. I have a physical disability involving my back and because of this I've been in social security limbo for about a year. My partner makes all of our money and pays our bills. I feel so.. useless? I feel like I can't provide anything financially. I look at myself in the mirror and think I'm ugly and overweight. I've tried dieting and in general eating better but it always falls apart. I'm on appetite suppressants and my doctor has tweaked them a lot but we can't find a combo that will work for me. Because of how poorly I see myself I think I'm not a good fit for my partner. Maybe she's better off with someone else? Someone she doesn't have to take care of? 

Its.. been hard this past week to do anything other than sleep. I can't will myself to do anything I used to enjoy and attempting to force it just makes me unhappy. I keep looking into ways to further my education past high-school level and I just get feel absolutely drowned in how overwhelming it feels for someone my age. 

It feels like I'm on an island. And everyone who is in my life is sort of drifting away from that island. Not really because I very much still do have good relationships, but if -feels- like they're drifting away. In a way that i know is silly and doesn't make sense but feels real. 

I don't think I'm at risk tonight. The thoughts are back but I've been a fighter before and I hope to keep being one. However, in the past, I would reach a boiling point before my attempts where I just couldn't take it anymore. Part of me is very, very afraid of that while part of me would rather just be a memory.

1jg3kbc,1742515012.0,"A vent about my recent suicide attempt Just a little over a week ago I tried to overdose and slit an artery. I ended up chickening out last minute, I called a hotline because I felt scared and didn't want to be alone, they convinced me to let them help me and called an ambulance. This is how my family found out, and it's honestly been horrible since.

I've been suicidal for years, but that night I had been high on benzos (that or alchohol has become a habit for me recently, but it makes me more confident in going through with suicide so I've tried cutting down as much as I can after I got out of hospital). That night something was just different, and I felt a kind of acceptance and calm over the thought of death, so I decided to take a bunch of pain meds along with overdosing on valium. I was super drowsy and I don't remember much at all from then besides running a bath which I was gonna slit my wrists in.

I have barely any memories from the day of and a few days after my overdose, but I did end up calling the hotline after I slit my artery at the sight of the blood, I got scared. I remember waking up in the and then called my mother sobbing (she was on holiday abroad) and explained everything to her. I deeply regret it. I wish I either died or never said a thing and tried to hide it from her.

The situation I'm having now with my family is suffocating, I want to be left alone but they won't. They keep asking me how they can know I won't do it again, since they didn't see the signs. I completely understand, they want me to be safe and they love me. But I have ""given up"" and they seem to think my attempt was a cry for help, which I do not want. I feel numb towards the whole thing, they want to up my anti-depressants which will just add needless suffering as it really sucks for me to get on/off or increase, I get super bad flu like symptoms and insomnia.

I feel like my family are pushing me to attempt again with how suffocating it feels, I am scared as my previous attempt felt so horrible. My plan was to knock my self out with valium and tramadol while bleeding out in the tub but I didn't consider the sickness and I was feeling so sick and anxious, that ontop of the bleeding pushed me to call for help. But I feel trapped, I don't want to suffer while dying, nor do I want my family to suffer, but I do not want to go on.

I know people say that it gets better, but I cannot wait for that. I am not interested in continuing as there isn't anything for me in this world. The only thing that's keeping me here now is my cat. May sound sad but I love her more than I've loved anything, and I don't want to leave or possibly confuse her.

I can't take a walk in my local park anymore, I constantly look for ways to commit suicide. I chart all the locations in my head I pass by, like the tree branches that look sturdy enough to hang my self off of and the bridge that I could throw my self off of. And it makes me feel ill.

The attempt was the easiest part for me, it's been dealing with the consequences of my actions that hurts me the most. I feel like I lost a bit of my self when I tried to die that night, now I just want to make sure I succeed next time, I want to feel that peace I felt the night I attempted, I felt free and relief at the realisation I could make it and would make it all stop just like that.

1jg8eg4,1742530217.0,"I have the oddest reason for being suicidal. On one hand, suicide is an unsurprising trajectory for my life. I had a fairly typical childhood as a Mexican kid in America up until I a) earned a scholarship that would've been a full ride to college, only for my mom to be deported to Mexico the summer before 6th grade, resulting in me staying behind in AZ while my family moved to Tijuana and b) lost said scholarship two years later due to severe depression and poor performance. 

Did 8th grade in Tijuana, moved to California for high school. Did terribly for similar reasons, but adding in a traumatic friendship with a severely codepdent, mentally ill person who leaned on me to stay alive. I called 911 to stop this person's suicide attempt after school one day. We were each other's only friend for the great majority of high school.

COVID hit, I graduated high school, and I start community college only to fail for similar reasons but lie to my parents about being in school to feel like my time was my own. 

I try again the next year. Crash and burn. Continue to lie to my parents. Meet a guy on Tinder, have a turbulent 2-month thing that I then obsess over for 2 years nonstop. Agoraphobically hermit into my room except to leave for the various jobs I pick up over the years as I go from 18 to 19 to 20 to 21, saving nothing, budgeting nothing, eventually picking up a weed-smoking habit and spending many nights (and many birthdays/new year's/christmases) drinking alone. Get on Grindr somewhere during that time. Have a bunch of unsafe and secretive sex under my parents' noses. 

Then at 21, really hit a nasty snag when I fall into a loop of something I can't determine is gender dysphoria or trans OCD - still can't. Really get suicidal. 

Enter reality creation cult. This is when the batshit stuff begins - I begin to lean into an interpretation of some of my more unstable traits as ""schizophrenic"" and create a narrative where things that have happened in my life contribute to this idea of myself as schizophrenic, as interpreting certain entities as ""gods"", a lot of frankly concerning stuff that I was indulging with a lot of weed use during this very, very unstable period. I start getting this lady's videos in my YouTube feed. Naturally, at the end of my rope, they seem like magic I'm willing to buy, so I join her ""alchemy lab"" and start posting, and oh boy things go off the rails. 

I meet this person who goes by White Rabbit, and the psychotic delusions just full-on explode. She claims she's three entities sharing a body, that she's literally God, that she can manipulate 3D objects magically, there's channeling involved, she talks about ""bringing forth Wonderland"", she convinces me I died and this is the afterlife, I literally believe wholeheartedly that the SCP Foundation is real for several months of my life. 

This ""lab"" fully encourages these delusions and spiritual detachment from reality. I'm in Discord servers with people LARPing as mythological gods, I'm believing that I'll be able to magically manifest a future with this guy I met at around this time who was really lovely and has no clue the extent of my absolute fucking insanity. 

I get so deep into this that, at a certain point, it takes the wake-up call from a person who's not totally fucking deluded for me to realize that... this is not normal, or right, or reflective of ANYTHING real. And that's when it all comes crashing. Down. 

See, all this channeling stuff, this literal magic I was supposedly doing under the guidance of this White Rabbit character? It felt so consequential. It felt like changing the world. And you know what it was? I'm going to tell you what it was: it was dancing in my living room high on weed. It was believing I would be able to reach out and phase through the mirror if I just believed.

To a degree I am humiliated to admit, it was believing that this ""magic"" would make it so I wouldn't have to work to manifest a reality I wanted. So when the delusion fell apart, I was left quite literally shattered. I could not believe how I had believed this shit, actually believed it, for so long. 

And worse? It left everything, everything, feeling twice as pointless as before. I'd always been existentially troubled. I'd always been depressive and nihilistic and dissociative and just generally very, very not in sync with things. But now? Now? It was like my soul was being burned alive. 

I cut off contact with White Rabbit, but honestly, a week or so goes by and I go back because I'm fucking gutted beyond repair. I have to indulge this fantasy because real life is too. Much. And I fully admit that ""real life"" wasn't ""go out and work 9-5, pay my own bills, make my own meals, suffer for my own shit"" but ""live with my parents, spend all day inside, stuck with my own thoughts"". 

It just gets weirder. She's the only person I'm talking to for a solid month and I get worse and worse and worse wanting to die or decorporealize or whatever I could do to poof out of existence in the face of life, any form of life, being too much. Until she blocks me, not because of the negativity but because I ""broke my promise"" to her to tell the guy I was seeing about the dysphoria/trans OCD stuff. She would send a fucking stolen picture of someone's rabbit witch OC and pretend it was some kind of mystical entity. 

At this point, I'm just going through the fucking motions. It's so bizarre I don't expect anyone to read this, let alone understand it, but I literally just don't want to participate in life, ever, in any capacity, and I don't know if I'm antisocial or dissociated or broken but I don't feel anything. Not even numbness, just... nothing. Blankness. The only thing I can feel is that I hate the thought of traumatizing and devastating my family with my suicide, who have not even the slightest idea of any of this. 

Life is just too big and complicated and has too many moving parts - I felt that since long before this break, whatever you want to call it. I don't want to engage. I want out. White Rabbit even took that from me, in a sense; ""death isn't an out,"" she said, like we're all stuck here in some recursive cosmic loop that you can never escape. Sure hope not. 

If any of this made any sense, thanks for reading this far. Happy to answer any questions. I feel like a husk of a human being and I'm only existing with the hope that I either die in my sleep or have the means to take my life into my own hands soon.

My parents laughed at the way i screamed when it happened. My mom keeps reminding me how its my fault and belittling and micromanaging me. Only thing that matters to her is that i get a good gpa and get a degree. 

I struggle with diagnosed depression, anxiety, and ocd. Ever since a young age its been a strive to be perfect, to have perfect grades, to be the perfect child, to be the top of the class.

Today i was feeling extra under and having a hard time. She came in fussing at me for a missed assignment that i need help and feedback from my teacher with. I felt so numb i wound up sitting there. I worked my ass off for 1.5 hours trying to get it done so i could go to an event but i couldnt understand it and got overwhelmed. She then came in and started berrating me again for not asking for help, even though i did, and refused to help me when asked. 

At that point i relapsed. 

I started feeling a little more together and okay but then she  came in to discuss my work once more. When she demanded to know why i was so off, i tried telling her and she blew up. How since im 17 my mental and physical welbeing isnt their issue and that i need to do stuff for myself and how she wont be involved anymore etc. And all i could do was sit there. 

All i could think was if this is what i have to deal with anytime i need help anymore im better off leaving. Only thing keeping me here is my dog. My 1 can survive w/o me easily. My newest puppy didnt even care i was gone for a few days. Only one who would struggle would be my service dog vapor. I fear he wouldnt be able to move on and would die of a broken heart.

1jfz4ht,1742503461.0,"Life is better for some people when it isn't experienced at all I've been suicidal since I was 9. Every waking moment since then has been just about me fantasizing my own demise and the relief that comes with it, even though you don't really feel anything, you just cease from feeling at all. The more I hold out my suicide or fail, the more I regret not killing myself.

I really tried. I tried but it seems like everything in the world is set against me. There is nothing left of value here, to be honest.

I was born disadvantaged from the very beginning. I'm a selfish leech - I'm completely and utterly useless and I live off of someone else's hard work. I feel guilty about it even though I can't help it. There is nothing important or valuable about me or what I have to offer. I'm not particularly smart or athletic, on the contrary, I'm extremely uninteresting and easily forgettable. I've let other people down for the most basic things with absolutely no reason to. Every set of experiences up until now has been laid out to make my life even worse. Life is insanely meaningless, harsh and just not worth it for the surface-level, double-edged rewards. Humans go out of their way to make everybody's lives worse. But nobody actually cares enough to help this endless cycle of misery. I am 100% convinced there is more evil than good in this world.

Nothing I do seems to make it better. I'm way too far gone, I've ruined myself too bad. Other people have ruined me badly as well, but I've done more bad decisions than good. I fucked up too much. And every day I suffer for that.

I know there are other people that are much more unfortunate than me, I do. My question is, if they do have it worse, how come none of them have given up yet? Is it due to the fact that I'm just weak and exaggerating? Maybe it's just all in my head? Because I really can't see myself living another year this way.

This might sound fucked up, and it probably is, but I just wish I had been an abortion or a miscarriage of some sort. I can't even fathom why anyone would want to bring another life in this horrible world. You'd do that unborn human a huge favour by never birthing it in the first place.

If not for my god-awful upbringing, things would be different. If it weren't for my country's firearm regulation, I would've offed myself ages ago. My family ruined everything in my fucking life. Nothing makes me happy anymore.

1jg3yrf,1742516152.0,"can parents be punished for giving 🍃 to their kid post-mortem? BACKGROUND : 

my mother & i have a strained relationship due to emotional neglect as a kid & drug abuse throughout my life. right now shes recovering alcoholic but is prescribed 1/2 an ambien & some pain pills/patch. she does THC and kratom 'recreationally' & also has major health problems. i feel more like her parent than her child. this is a major reason why they let me smoke too 

my dad is probably the person who i am closest to, but can be enabling sometimes.

although they used to not really prioritize my safety (drunk driving, parties, being around my parents making fools of themselves) after i had multiple attempts, was put inpatient, and CPS came around they became much better parents and grew closer.

ACTUAL QUESTION : 

my parents allow me to smoke carts/weed pens & take edibles. i would self-harm daily, even taking pictures of it if sober. it's less about the lack of weed and more how overstimulation and boredom leads my mind to obsessive, self-violent, and gorey ideas.

i make good arguments, so after my mom relapsed they stopped fighting my purchases of them, now buying it for me with my allowance that they give me. they had a deadline for when they wanted me to stop (new years) but aren't enforcing it as my mental health continues to spiral. 

i know its bad for my development (smoking from ages 14-16, turning 17 in a few months). its not their fault. it would be obvious after my death via drug screening, id prob miss getting rid of a few boxs/dead vapes/receipts/purchases, and through messages of me asking my parents to buy one.

I TRIED TO LIVE! But unfortunately life is a bit too heartless i guess. 

I'm 17 and yea probably addicted to alcohol and nicotine, i have no support, narcissistic parents, and im just fucking depressed to the point where i can no longer obtain new information and let it stick, i cannot take care of myself properly to the point where i have foot infections and probably some kind of parasite infection, um, im transgender and funnily enough i did come out to my parents but instead of an actual answer i was just straight up ignored. for 2 days, and then they messaged me casually after 2d of ignoring me just asking if i wanted food later. like what? anyways yeah. nobody gaf about me, not even me at this point. hopefully when i die i can be reincarnated into a better family and as a girl because wtf was this life i mean seriously this life was so boring and trauma filled. sexually abused as a kid, lots of fucking mental and physical abuse at home, barley went to school, had no friends, nobody again really giving a fuck about me and then me ... obviously being useless and having a low self esteem my whole entire life. even my looks suck dick.

1jg335z,1742513714.0,"8 week waitlist, dont think i can wait After almost 8 yrs of struggling i’ve finally got onto a waitlist for CBT. I have horrible on and off mental health (fine for a few hours-months, then depressed af for hours-months). I had a suitability assessment and will be recieving step 3 CBT with a high intensity therapist 1on1, but the waitlist is around 8 weeks. CBT on average takes 6-20 sessions, so thats 14-28 weeks before i’d be put on any medication or anything. My life is literally halted. I’m doing horrible at school but i cant stand being a suck up and using my MH as an excuse because it isnt that bad. 

I was fine last week, ended up doing weird shit. sexted so many strangers last week, sent nudes to like 10+ people, lost my virginity to someone i had known online for 2 days and in real life for a few hours (i am a very private person, don’t like hookup and dating culture) blew 70 quid on drinks that night too (im unemployed and that money should be going to medication.) Pulled multiple all nighters but the most i was up for was only 36 hours. Came out to my Nan after 5 years of hiding. Past few nights i’ve been paranoid someone is in my room at night. 

Now after getting off a call with my friends i just feel so low. Right now is a semi-good date to die. My mums bday has just passed so it’ll be a year b4 she has to have it without me, our concert is mid april, so my family have enough time to grieve so they can properly enjoy it, mothers day is soon but it’s never been a massive thing in our household. 

I think im 50/50 on properly dying or just doing something so i can have a break from life for a while. I literally have no other way to attempt other than an OD which doesnt even kill you quickly and isnt even a guaranteed death. 

My MH is ruining my life. I dont want to be here if i get worse in weird directions again (the sexual activity, paranoia). That isnt me or my personality, but i’m not myself when i’m depressed either right, so literally who am i?? 

I used to be so good at artwork, i still am somewhat, but i’d be so much better if i wasnt depressed. I can barely pick up a pencil or tablet and I am supposed to be doing an art BTEC and going to university for art. I didn’t do A-levels despite good grades because I knew i wouldnt be able to cope mentally. 

Idk, ive just wasted my life and i’m sick of the cycle of getting better and thinking i’m cured just to be hit with depression all over again.

1jg0e8q,1742506653.0,"Acting out suicidal thoughts to make a statement I don’t want to die but maybe I do. Not really. I just need to get out of here.

I’ve been bullied for not even long but it’s breaking me. Today, I lost it. The girl who torments me said something again, and instead of helping, my teacher and classmates told me never to come back and laughed at my breakdown. No one even came to check on me. I don’t think it was a panic attack but I felt like I was cramping. And I never even knew how much they despised me.
I’m diagnosed as highly intelligent but lack all social skills. I tried speaking to those in power, but they all blamed me, saying I was responsible for how I was treated. I’m not allowed in classes by that girl, and if I show up, they call me a whore. I think they do that because I look like a girl or because it’s what I yelled at her, after trying to understand why she does this, she just laughed at me and said I don’t matter here.
The performance gap in my environment is extreme, though much of it comes down to motivation. I love sharing knowledge and used to guide those behind of me, but instead, I was pushed into a “social worker” role with unmotivated, mean students. I refused, and after relentless teasing, I snapped and called them stupid. To me, it was just frustration but to them, it was me wanting war or something. I was accused of even worse things, yet no one is telling me what.

Reading this back, I already sound like the biggest asshole maybe I am. I don’t know. But I can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to be here either. I just need a break.

Now, I’m planning to take just enough pills to be admitted not to die, and definitely not to be locked away. I have some heavy stuff laying around so maybe enough to have an actual chance of not surviving. Maybe my body can decide if it needs it to stop? Maybe it’s more of a statement, a way of saying, Does no one see what’s happening to me? Does that even make sense. I don’t know.

1jfze5o,1742504131.0,"Need advice Hello, this post might be a long read and I’m sorry for that, I am just looking for some advice. 

My life went downward spiral since late 2022, it wasn’t really good before, but I tried to make the best of it. I was always depressed and sad, but still had my goals and worked on myself. Since February 2022, a war broke out in my country and I decided to help out of my good will, I was 19 and a second year engineering student in university at the time. Long story short, I was mobilized (without my consent) and sent to the combat zone. I had a good faith in people and despite that fact did what I could to help. In the meantime, my “friends” and other people didn’t really care. They just lived their lives and didn’t care about the war and everything. I was reading group chats about them meeting up and playing games while I was at literal war. It really hurt. After coming back from my first deployment in July, I asked for a permission to go back to my university to finish my degree and get special courses to receive officer education, but that request was denied and I was told “to serve like the rest of us”, despite the fact that I was underage for it legally. 

And that’s where it became worse. After first deployment, my unit had drastic casualties and I wanted to at least try to stay alive and tried to do other work. I still had a dream of coming back to my university and working on my life. It was hard, but in the end I was noticed to perform technical work (won’t disclose much, irrelevant). Long story short, I was caught up in doing “dirty work” for business of selling UAVs with army coverage and decided to leave. And so I did and found another place for service.

On the new place, I did a good tech job and actually learned new things and it was fun, until one day I was considered “defective” by some officers, because I looked sad and was depressed. They have forcefully sent me to the hospital and got rid of me, throwing me away and hurting me further. It hurt me especially because at that time, I was trying to do a lot of useful work that made me fell accomplished (working with international partners, repairing tech and other things) and I was just forcibly removed. After that move, my life became worse and I became very sad. It’s like I woke up again, seeing how bad everything is. I have been struggling to find a strength to move further, contemplating what happened and remembering the life I lead before. I realized that I might never achieve my goals and everything is irrelevant.

I have been sent to the mental hospital later for a “cure”. Doctors said that it’s just a depression, gave me some crappy SSRI and discharged me after couple weeks, saying that it’s not their problem. Then, one day, I got really exhausted and OD on some certain meds with the intend of killing myself, but I couldn’t really do it. I was sent to the hospital again and doctors repeated the procedure without caring. 

Later I tried to get my life together, I found another unit, managed to get a transfer and now trying to begin there now. But in this new place, I have applied for some certain position, but was sent somewhere else, because they needed my skills elsewhere. I am a UAV technician (you could say), but local commanders decided to use me in other field because they want that. It’s a thing in this army, instead of helping your, these people want to make things worse for you. I absolutely lost any trust in people after my history of service. HQ is actually interested in giving me the position I wanted, but local commanders object and use me in other way. I can’t really explain that much, but it just works that way and I have no rights to argue.

So, to sum things up. I have spent last 3 years of my life in the army against my will. What started as my volunteering to help people in difficult times, ended in making me a slave to the system. I was kicked out of my university when I was on frontlines, because I didn’t finish exams, but when they discovered I was in the military, they re-enlisted me in the university with a catch (I was on scholarship, but they made me pay for it and took me back on a “previous year”, I was third year and became second year). 

All my “friends” now have masters degrees, good jobs, girlfriends, they are happy and I am just a broken nobody. All I do all the time is just living in regret and sadness. I just want to go back, I am but a husk of my former self. I don’t even have my bachelors. Long time ago I had a dream and a plan for my life and now it’s just in ruins. Fun thing is, I am in the army for 3 years now and currently I am 22, but the end of service is nowhere to be seen. So I sit in this new place before deployment and think about my life and what could have been. I have access to firearms and can finish it, but I am (for some reason) afraid. 

I didn’t disclose many things, but the post is extremely long anyway, so I’ll stop it here. I appreciate it deeply if your read through it and could give me some advice. Thanks you for your time

1jfzaxb,1742503905.0,"I'm suicidal and nothing helps This might turn out to be long, but I will try keeping it short. 

With the pandemic I had to go back to my parents house, and it's just been hell since then. At first it was OK, I was still in college, had an internship, and bc everyone was still at home, I was able to keep in touch with most of my friends. But then I graduated, got sick, had to quit my internship/job because of it, started a long treatment (thyroid issues) that is still not over. My friends started not talking to me as often, since they could go out now, but they live in a different state from me (I went to college in another state). Living with my parents is terrible, we do not get along at all, I feel like they hate me, and they use me as a (not literal) punching bag all the time, shoving all of their disagreements and sadness and frustrations out on me.

In 2023, when all this mess had started and I realized I was getting depressed and suicidal again (had been for a long time before, from early teens until I was around 17), I made a pact with myself that I would persevere, and I would keep trying to make things better for me, until I was 30, at least. That gave me around 6 years to fix things. I was alone, sick, unemployed, depressed, but I was determined to get better. 

Late 2024 I managed to convince my parents to help me with a post graduation course in the same city I went to college. Unfortunately I'd have to live with my brother, and right after I paid for the course, and a few weeks before I moved, we had a horrible fight (because of our dog, of all things). We also do not get along, and have had multiple fights before, with him physically threatening me. This fight, he sent me texts threatening my life. I told my parents but they did nothing, except have a ""talk"" with him. I was extremely distressed and fearing to be actually harmed. I ended up living a year and a half enclausered on my bedroom since I was terrified of being in the same room as him. During 2024 we also had multiple fights over stupid house stuff, he lives with his girlfriend (the apartment belongs to our parents so he doesn't pay any bills), I felt like her being there was an invasion of my privacy, and they are extremely dirty, they'd never do things thinking was in the apartment, always leaving dirty dishes with nothing for me to use for instance. Stupid, harmless, but fucking stressful. 

During 2024 i started actively working the End Depression plan. I started doing to the gym, training judo, I had my post graduation course 2x a week, I went to multiple doctors for my several health issues, started following a diet plan (after I got sick I gained a lot of weight, which is bad because I have knee problems), started going to parties friends invited me to and tried to meet new people, got on dating apps, started doing random activities to meet new people, was intensely looking for a job, had psychological and psychiatrist help. 

Nothing worked. I got job from which I was fired after 2 months and couldn't get anything after, my relationships with my friends deteriorated to the point of no existence, I made no new relationships, I lost no weight, my health didn't get better, I was more suicidal than I the beginning.

I had to stop seeing my therapist. She was the third one I tried. The first seemed to be extremely angry at me for being depressed and coming from money. The second was ok, but we weren't making any progress, and she eventually said she couldn't see me anymore. The third acted like everything that was happening was my fault, and treated me like I was stupid. The therapy itself didn't help either, I was stressed the whole time for days before the session. 

By the end of last year I had to move back with my parents, again. I have no money to support myself so I can't move away from them. I have no job. I have no perspective of getting any. 

This among a lot of other small things, my grandma died, then one month later my dog died. On the topic of dogs, turns out I'm autistic and that's like, the only thing I care about. Guess who became allergic to dogs during the pandemic? Despite living with 9 dogs. When my girl passed away I was devasteted. The only thing that kept me going was that I had to keep taking care of the other ones. It freaked me out, that I was more disturbed by my dog passing away than my grandma. 

Now a days I have no strength for anything. I still go to the gym but I've given up on the other stuff. I only talk to one person other than my parents. I feel miserable talking to them. They alway put me down and make me feel worse and criticize me for being dependent on them still. I have not had any sort of physical intimacy in months. I don't even mean sex or cuddling, I just mean a nice hug. The only thing besides my dogs that still gives me any joy is playing baldur's gate 3.

Im studying to try and get a government job, use my degree for something, but even that seems so far away from my abilities. I feel so guilty all the time, it always feels like I'm saying and doing the wrong things. My parents are good on money and I have an inheritance to receive, so it's not like I'm going to die on the streets if they pass away suddenly and I was still unemployed. But what kind of life is that? I can't do anything for me, especially living with them and in such a small city, having absolutely no money of my own. I have no friends to talk to. I feel so guilty for being so fucking useless. I had - have - everything, money, stable family life, access to health, education . And yet I'm this? I am a huge failure. I'm sure you're all mad at me too, reading this and thinking that I'm stupid and useless and dumb for not being to figure out a way to get things done when I have the one thing most people don't. 

I have four more years to my deadline and I already have things pretty planned out. I just don't know how I'm going to keep hiding until then. People around me know I'm depressed, I've told them, but no one seems to believe me. I figure my parents would try to help, but how do I go about telling them they're one of the reasons I want to kill myself, you know? I don't want to cause them that kind of hurt. I'm really at a loss of how to proceed for the next years. Kinda want to go under my blankets and become immobile until then.

1jfi9aa,1742450372.0,"Girlfriend is suicidal, and I feel guilty over my feelings I just need to get this off my chest because I don’t know how to process what’s happening and if it’s a “normal” reaction.

I have struggled with passive suicidal ideation, but never suicidal ideation. I have never made an attempt, plan, etc. 

My girlfriend has been struggling with suicidal ideation for a couple months now. We’ve been working really hard on it, she’s going to therapy, taking medication, keeping herself busy with school and work, going out on dates, everything we can think to improve it. Nothing has helped.

I am currently on a work trip, and she called me to let me know she took an entire bottle of naproxen, but panicked after and called 911. She doesn’t take naproxen and her friend is supposed to handle her meds, so I’m guessing the friend is just a dumb bitch and left shit lying around. When I’m home all the meds and kitchen knives are locked in my gun safe that you need my thumb print for, and all my guns are at my dad’s house until this ends. 

Now onto why I’m making this post… I am so fucking angry. I’m so sick of dealing with it and worrying about it. I’m not angry at her, I know she’s not trying to, but this has been taking up so much of my time, money and mental energy for so long that I am absolutely sick of it, and I hate that I have to lie to her and say “it’s ok” so I don’t upset her. I want to be honest with her always, but this isn’t something she needs to know. I hate that I have completely lost hope that it will get better because we’ve tried almost everything. I hate this nagging feeling I have in my head that the stress of this will last until it breaks me or she ends her life. I’ve been going to therapy myself for it, and my therapist is doing her best but realistically all she can really do is soften the blow. Nothing will improve how I feel about it until she gets better. 

Before anyone asks, she’s not pregnant, she’s not using drugs, her family life is fine if not a bit tense from what I know. There isn’t anything specific in her life dragging her down that I know of.

I've just found myself in a heaps worth of debt at the age of 27. $50,000 from Student loans and $23,000 from auto loans. I am feeling pretty overwhelmed right now by the numbers and am uncertain if I can even pay it off without putting my entire life on pause for years. It's caused me to feel this burdening urge to just end it all before my life spirals into eternal debt. I realize that what I'm saying may sound like an overreaction, and it very well may be, but the feelings right now are not. 

Is this a normal amount of debt to have at my age? I am still in my Master's program, but won't finish for another year and a half. I am not making a lot of money right now and will be making even less when I begin interning later this year.

Everyone says that life is just that, the ups and downs. But it just doesn’t seem worth it to me, the ups only last so long and when I’m down I’m really down. 2 months ago I made the impulsive decision to buy a helium tank, with hopes of an easy going.

1jfimtm,1742452017.0,"The end’s approaching I truly believe these are end times. I’ve witnessed my downfall up until this point, it slowly built up then came crashing down. I’m just a burden; a thing that’s there for my parents to remember I exist and then lament. Have lost virtually all my friends, family friends, family turned their back on me. Immediate family made me their enemies. Struggling so badly with anxiety and horrible intrusive thoughts. I don’t know why or how but people can read my thoughts and my actions which is so scary. I can’t even think or cry or sleep peacefully because my neighbours hate me and keep trying to disrupt me all the time by slamming doors, mocking me by coughing etc. It’s been days since I slept well. 

I think back to when I was that clumsy little 4 year old going into school for the first time, dropping my things, picking them up, then dropping them again and I’m still the same. When I was 4 and sat alone and couldn’t zip my bag so started crying and kids gave me weird looks and mocked me crying; was very much indicative of my life today. Some people are meant to be alone and not moulded to be smart or strong enough for the world and I truly believe I’m one of those people. They won’t fit in no matter how much they try. I don’t see my life getting better from here. I’ve had the privilege to be born in a physically perfect body and never lacked anything materially, yet I turned out to be a total waste of space. There are people who have smiled at me and wanted to know me but I just rejected them because I don’t feel anyone should have the displeasure of knowing me. 

If I could give my life in exchange for someone who lost theirs I would. If I was to die painlessly tomorrow I’d want it to happen. I’ll be 20 in a couple months and I don’t think I’ll make it till then. I’ve been struggling for a long time and it needs to be put to an end.

Recently I’ve been in a cycle where in a week I’m extremely suicidal and the next I try to lock in to do things. I’ve made several attempts and two times it got so far that my neck had markings or my face was so cooked. A big part of it recently is my relationship with my ex who claimed to be avoidant but she broke my trust multiple times then love bombs me afterward and then I’d ask to confirm what do you want. It got so bad that she even ghosted me on birthday. She’d try to talk but when I ask for an explanation, accountability, apology, or just simple reassurance she’d ghost me again. Two weeks after I made the call to split and my mental got so much better that I don’t get exhausted and spiral into actually planning and attempting suicide again. I do feel those thoughts but I’ve been doing baby steps to be better. I dominate at work. I’m keeping my social life good and I got a support system. They’re encouraging me to go to the gym and I plan too. I got my competitive edge again.

The reason why Im explaining this all is because I cant seem to get back on my feet for school.

Fast forward to present time, and over the past two years I've had severe trauma from mental health providers. Basically, the woman was accusing me of drug seeking and totally gaslighting me, and I broke down and said ""if I don't get proper help, I'm going to end up killing myself."" I didn't say this as a threat. I said it out of frustration and fear. This woman immediately threw me into the psych ward. It was awful. I went in for a routine med check, and ended up in the psych ward for five days. Completely unnecessary and absolutely terrifying. 

Since then, I've realized there is no one I can talk to about my suicidal thoughts. I'm not close to the point of actually taking my life, honestly it scares the crap out of me, but I think about it. A lot. I'm so afraid of I tell anyone that, I'm going back into the hospital. And for anyone who thinks the hospital could be helpful, it was a joke.

As a kid,I already was an asshole.I won't go into details but I really was absolutly horrible and cruel.Yesterday,Confessed how much I lied to my family and they forgave me,I don't know how.It could almost have been the best day of my life.But no.Two years prior to today,I was groomed online by 14-15 y.o when I was 10-11(We broke up fortunatly).I was scared to blame him.So I blame myself.I convinced myself I could consent,seducted him and It was my fault,and that sex was normal for children(I think I enjoyed being Molested and then watched lots of porn in secret especialy BDSM).and since,I paraphilic thoughs and fantasies that I've been aroused by.I though it was normal to think about those things(Fellow children and also teens/adults,also slightly younger and I mostly wanted to be them/Because I was molestedat that age) because I though If I could consent they could too.I have especialy being fantasizing and masturbating about being the child and being the one molested/raped/incest almost and seeing it(not always,Which is why I want to die.I kinda wish I was still molested...) always self directed.A few days ago I realized how disgusting and wrong these thoughs were.I've cried alot these past few days.I am broken,I cannot be fixed.I have intrusive thoughs about younger children and voices that tell me it's alright/they would enjoy it because I enjoyed being molested(Which is disgusting but my brain refuses to know that),similar stuff and intrusive thoughs about molesting children(I also somehow what to be that child which worries me but as I said...I kinda want to be molested and all...)Zoophilia(I know it's not and I feel like I am not disgusted enough anymore,And I am numb after crying so much,It disgusts me even more)and lots of incest.I've also had lots of fantasies about me getting fuck€d and pretty violent ways....I also though I should loose my virginity at like,9.I have also accidentaly viewed child porn and I wanted to be that child and searched animal porn by curiosity...I wake up every morning feeling like the most disgusting person ever.Like a monster.I want to die.I am so gross.I can't currently get Proffesional help,Unfortunately.I just cannot.There is no hope left for me.I want to jump off the window or slit my wrists.The world would be better off me.I feel bad because my family are terrified of me commiting but I don't feel like I deserve to be missed.I am messed up in every ways possible,I can't live whit myself anymore.My family are literaly angels,But I am a stain on the whole bloodline.I've tried to drink alcohol behind their backs but I don't like the taste.I've almost wrotte my last wishes and my will.I have not much empathy either,it scares me(I never had much emphathy),and I am scared to do anything to a real child or even to a grown up in my family.I don't know how I can lack of basic morals and disgust to certain stuff,It makes me wanna die even more,It's as if no almost thoughs can make go away my very disturbing thoughs/voices telling me to manipulate people and all...I'm mortified.Am I the monster I swore to never become....deep inside I am disgusted but it's getting worse.I don't know,something changed in my mind after I was molested and all...Also I preffer older men than me since?(I know I have dad issues but....)At the same time,I'm somewhat scared of Adults.My family are mostly older people who are relativly close to die and I feel like I just brought suffering at their end.I am tired of my brain trying to sexualize everything that are absolutly inocent and stuff that should never be sexualized...I never had that before,I am tired.I am very distressed from all the very disturbing fantasies I had.

I also have weird and uncomfortable mood/personality swings....As much as my mind can be disturbed and I can be suicidal I can also become numb and/or weirdly and uncomfortably euphoric(Still shaking,feeling empty and fake,heart palpitations,feeling cold,nervous)and mentaly ""Normal""(Not aroused by those things and disgusted)....It's as if there was two people in there....or maybe it's some kind of coping machanism for my brain....I'm lost.It feels as if my brain was trying to ignore the obvious issue or something....which doesn't make me feel better.I hate these Euphorias/Numbness and stuff moments...it worries me,I'm still worried,but my brain somehow tells me it's alright and all while it isn't.Sometimes I just feel peaceful though....It's like a roller-coaster.

My brain also associate numbers to very specific things and stuff and wouldn't allow me to fantasise about some ages for some reasons???Maybe I made some kind of link between s€x and the age I was molested???Also,I always had a bad mental image of adults,I don't know why.My brain victimizes adults but not children also?Is my brain thinking upside down?


I also watched alot of slautherhouse vids when I was younger(And tried to do same to real animals) and had a very morbid curiosity in general.I wanted to commit homicide(Fortunatly not anymore) and I was very narcisistic and selfish,homophobic and all the brainrot stuff(I am once more,not anymore...except the morbid curiosity).I literaly still laugh about suffering and literaly gore like a fucking maniac.I feel guilty but I also think I kinda enjoy violence.....Maybe I'm sadistic???


Sorry,I felt like I need to vent here.advices are welcome.Im so sorry if it sounds gross,I am gross.Im just tired of waking up,crying,Having those disgusting thoughs,the groinial responses,Flinching,Trembling,and being nauseous,and struggling whit hygene.I just want to sleep and never wake up.I wish...I was normal.Im eaten up alive by guilt.I am also tired of my radical moodswings....And the self harm.Unfortunatly(people will say fortunatly)my family have hid the scisors and the nail cutter.I am tired of seeing everything and everyone as sexual.I sometimes think about myself being eviscerated,ect...I don't want to eat anymore.I want to vomit,I feel like food is stuck in my throat.Why can't I be perfect.

Sometimes, I wish there was a God to fix me.Or maybe that God is punishing me and everyone for existing.

I feel like I cannot be fixed.There is no hope...I just want peace and nothingless.Like before I existed.If anyone has useful advices,I will take them.I am tired.I can't even sleep anymore,everyday is hell.The only reason I don't kill myself is because my cowardly ass fears pain.I just want to cry and be a little kid again....My brother shouldn't have died when he was born,I should've.am I...a Monster?I feel like I am,I don't want to exist anymore,or at least not think at all and stay in my room...Am I fucked up beyond fixing?I feel like I can't rest,that If I let my guard down,my mind will be corupted by these thoughs and I will do something horrible.It's somehow becoming more and more difficult to lissen to reason and seeing what is right or wrong,I get very cruel and disturbing thoughs and I am scared and tired of arguing whit them to no avail due to my fucked up mind...I am almost tempted to just drink up the bottle of wiskey in the closet behind my parrent's and try killing myself....I can't sleep in peace anymore.I want to desapear.Why does my family even love someone like me...My art sucks,My weight sucks,my grade sucks,my imagination sucks,my thoughs suck,I SUCK.I am a disappointment.I can't pretend everything is alright anymore.Being alive sucks.I am pretty pathetic for being in love whit a fictional woman.Since I was born I just brought misery to myself and the others.I just want it to end sometimes.If my dad met me he would be so disgusted and disapointed.I can't go on whit those cruel thoughs I never wanted...I must be Illegal.Im tired of those thoughs about slightly younger children because I am trying to gauge my reaction to them because I am scared of being a p€do or something(Even though I wouldn't even dream of being intimate whit one nor am I atracted to them???)...Please help.My intrusive thoughs and past fantasies scare the sh!t out of me.I feel like my place should be in an mental asylum whit meds at this point.I want to die so bad,I don't beleive I can fixed anymore....I don't beleive I'll make it to 2026.But at the same time,I'm scared for my family....I'm stuck.Uterly stuck.I don't go outside,I'm scared to see children.I'm scared to be even more disgusting.What to do when your brain comes up everytime whit the intrusive though saying ""They would enjoy it"" everytime I see the most terrible things happen to a damn child....Am I some kind of monster or pedo?I would normaly be disgusted but my brain doesn't want to.Why can't I understand sexual trauma anymore....",0,2,0,"need opinions , worried myself.i

1jfkbzt,1742460033.0,"My life is pure trash and i can't live it anymore. I am done with life today. my entire life I have made to feel outcasted from my own family, age 5 my mom marries someone who turns out to be a pedophile and does stuff to me and forces me to do stuff to him and my cousins while he watches. this goes on from age 5 to 8.

he also would beat me so badly to where I could barely sit because it would hurt. this went on from age 5 to 17.

When I was 8 my cousins dad came over no other adults were around. he made us kids do things to each other for hours then left. we never told anyone.

My mom never believed me nor did my grandma or any one else in the family. I was always called a liar, trash, stupid, and many other words. growing up I barely learned how to read and could barely spell. everyone made fun of me growing up. 

I never went to school, was always kept home to work in the yard or to handmow 10 acres of land or work in the field we had.
When I was 17, my step dad killed my 80 year old grandma who had severe asthma, he sprayed a full can of bug spray in the kitchen causing her to have a severe asthma attack and died that night. he did it on purpose for the will.

when I was 18 I walked in on my step dad and my moms uncle together in her bed. I told her that night infront of everyone, he threw hot coffee in my face and then my mom kicked me out of the house.

My mom was always trying to end her life, I grew up spending weeks in and out of the hospital by her bedside from overdoses. 

Was homeless from age 18 to 35. no one would hire me.
Lost my mom when I was 25, my biological dad when I was 23, only knew him for a few months. 

Didn't learn to read or write until I was 18/19 and homeless. That is also when I learned I had dyslexia and minor brain damage from years of beatings from my step dad.

Fast forward to today after 30 years of abuse from my family. my aunts, my cousins and being outcasted by them for over 10 years. I am turning 44 monday and I can't keep living like this.

I was diagnosed with Cptsd, severe chronic depression, paranoia, severe social anxiety and suicidal ideation. I have no friends and go months with no one to talk to, i have no one to game with and I have no support from anyone. I owe 3 years of payments on 3 different credit cards and I am -180 in the bank and living on ssi. I can't keep going like this...

I have never had a girlfriend, women don't want me, I have never had a vehicle and I desperately need a minivan to help me get around to places. I had a crown break off and can't get to a dentist because of no dental insurance. I was never taught dental hygiene growing up and now I need all of my teeth pulled and dentures but cannot afford it.

I live in a very small town in texas that is 30 miles away from anything and have to doordash everything which costs so much. 

i got into streaming 4 yrs ago to try to make friends. i got in with groups of older men who played teh same game as me after a year of streaming and having no one in my streams. things happened with one of their members i took up for the member, they kicked us both out. i went with said member to another group, things happened with that group, so that member and i left it due to drama from others. found another group of streamers and after a few months they slowly cut me out.
 
every time i said something i was wrong, but if someone else said it, it was perfectly okay, then they just straight up stopped talking to me.
 
i moved on to twitch they followed me on twitch harassed me on twitch in other streamers chats spreading bs about me. well, i keep finding streamers and people who keep doing the same thing. i gave up on streaming and just became a viewer.
 
this one streamer kept streaming palia, and she seemed cool, she kept giving me shoutouts when i asked her not to in her chat, she said everyone gets shoutouts here. the second time it happened i again asked her to not do it. she said you know i shout everyone out. the third time ie yesterday her mod shouted me out.
 
i gave a angry emote reply back to her mod and she scolded me on the stream saying don't give that emote to my mods. you show my mods respect etc. i dm'd her told her im done with her, she had no respect for me, but wants me to respect her mod when i get angry over them shouting me out.
 
needless to say, i had met a few people through her stream, and they all cut me off without a word. i log in palia and they all removed me from their friends banned me from their streams kicked me out of their discords without a word. it was like 6 people who did that.

one of the streamers talked me into reinstalling fortnite knowing i absolutely love fortnite but can't stand playing solo and i hate playing in squads because i get over stimulated. so i reinstalled it then woke up this morning to them removing me and blocking me for no reason.
 
i met a streamer who was playing palia a few months ago, had no viewers, after a week i introduced her to a friend i had for a year. and with in 3 weeks they made a small group and cut me out and stopped talking to me then started bad mouthing me.
 
even the friend i had for a year.
 
im just done with it. i can't take anymore

1jfif17,1742451062.0,"A life-long self prophecy of suicide seems to be coming into fruition I am near the limit of what I can withstand anymore. For my entire adult life I haven’t taken proper care of myself. Never went to a dentist or anything like that because I always felt I would kill myself before I hit 40, so why bother.  

I am currently 39, with my 40th birthday coming up and now more than ever I feel like I was right all along.  

In my 20’s I started taking handfuls of medication at a time, not giving a shit, hoping to hurt myself more and more. I wanted permanent damage to my body that would ensure I wouldn’t live too long. I then attempted suicide multiple times. I was somewhat successful once where my heart stopped, but I was resuscitated and woke up days later in the hospital.  I took out the catheter and IV and walked out, only to be arrested and handcuffed to the hospital bed until they could transfer me to Snowden a few days later.

I was forced into inpatient treatments at mental hospitals where I was just given crayons and told to sit around a shared community TV while a disturbed patient would throw cups of piss at people. I was forced many times into mental hospitals and it never helped.  
I tried going to a psychiatrist for several years with therapists as well. Given 13 different medications to take (13 prescribed at the same time) over the years and none of it helped either.  

My brother then killed himself. I hadn’t talked to him for a while and didn’t know he was also suffering. The loss hit my mom so hard (my only remaining family member) that I made a promise to myself that I wouldn’t do that to her and have since tried my freaking hardest to keep that promise.  

I dumped more money than I should have into a hobby to try and retain my sanity. I’ve tried to make friends but due to my agoraphobia I’ve never been successful. I have a few people that i try to text on occasion but it is all empty and not very deep. If I don’t text them first they will never message me. I’m more of an annoyance to them if anything.  

I haven’t dated in 6 years now either. I live alone, and pretty much never interact with people in real life. The isolation and depression lead me back to taking handfuls of sleeping pills at a time. Not to kill myself, but because it was a reckless, nonsensical method of self-harm and dulling the pain.  

I lost my job a month and a half ago, and things are looking incredibly bleak. My former employer never even gave me a reason for firing me, after almost 5 years there. In two weeks I will be bankrupt. My utilities will be overdue soon after followed by eviction. The job hunt has been awful, but the worst part is the isolation.  Endless isolation regardless of where I am.

I tried going out, but it always feels so empty—alone in a crowded place. I tried texting former coworkers, but they are increasingly more distant. I can feel those connections fade as they get used to days without me around. It saddens me, because they were about as close to friends as I’ve had in a long time.  Online conversations are also few and far between, but they all feel empty.

At night, I constantly find myself researching suicide methods. No one I know is awake to reach out to. I want to cry all the time but I haven’t been able to. I’m scared to tell anyone I know in real life about this. I know from previous experience they would only report me (thinking they are helping me), and I would be thrown back into another mental institution. I would rather die than ever go back to one of those again, and they would never think of me the same way again.

I’ve already narrowed my suicide method down and have the beginning of my plan set. I feel like by sometime next month, if things don’t change, I will just end up going through with it again. The last time I was dying, there was someone in the apartment that called 911 when they found me. This time, I live alone. No one would know for days.  

I’ve been homeless for a short bit in the past, and dealt with more shit in my life than I can fit in one Reddit post. Currently waiting for a handful of sleeping pills (I know this is not lethal, just something i stupidly do often when feeling like this) to mix with the alcohol in my system to knock me out for a bit, to give my brain a break for a few hours.

I can’t deal with this anymore. I’m tired of everything. I’ve only stuck around these extra years out of a promise. As I know my elderly mother wouldn’t be able to handle both her sons committing suicide, since I am all she has left. I’m angry (not sure if that is the best word) at my brother for making me live. But I am having such a hard time keeping that promise anymore.

1jfb246,1742426841.0,"Seeking resources for intelligent support regarding discussing suicide Hi, I 'm looking for suggestions on places I can just *talk* about suicide and suicidal thoughts free from pathologizing and Western psychiatric intervention.

Background: life of trauma, suicidal ideations my entire life. Turning 50 this year.  My entire life has been a series of strategies to try to buy time to stay alive

So, I have a background in Eastern philosophy. Studied anthropology and was gonna be a professor.  Have studied countless systems of psychology and spirituality.

I'm very exhausted at this point, and recent developments in the world have made me contemplate the issue of suicide.

I am looking for intelligent and compassionate people to discuss this with.  I reached out to ""The Living and Dying Project"" as an initial effort.

I am interested in discussing death and suicide with people trained in such conversations, or others who can sit with such difficult subjects.

I've watched many, many people die over the years who screamed out for help, but were othered and ostracized for even bringing up suicide.

In many ways it feels like an impossible situation: if you bring it up you immediately scare people away. If you're in a state where you're thinking about it a lot you have to talk to someone, you get further isolated you to try.  I swear this is why many people I know eventually succumbed. There's a lot of shadow projection and fear at play in these situations. Not to mention gaslighting, victim blaming, ableism, and good old bootstraps ideology.

This should not be a taboo subject.  We need people with the strength, experience, or training to hold space without pathologizing or abdicating to Western medicine and psychology (which in spite of what people might like to think has not done a great job of offering real solutions).  Suicide rates are skyrocketing in the USA particularly in younger populations.

Death is taboo. Suicide moreso. This silence kills.

Looking for novel suggestions, thank you!

We weren't close then, but she still came to show support.

Since then, we've healed our relationship and we're close now. I'm glad we are, because I think I'm the only member of our family who knows she's struggling. She's going through a divorce from an abusive ex-husband, she's got degrees but can't find a job in her field and is not getting calls back in the retail sector despite having retail experience. Her car just got totaled. Leasing offices keep giving her the run around and taking her money, so she's couch surfing. Worst of all, she's an entire time zone away from me and my husband and I live in an apartment with our two cats and a baby (my sister has a cat and dog, but her car is hypoallergenic and our cats would aggravate her allergies). 

We lost our mom to cancer at the beginning of last year and her death brought up old wounds and grievances that caused her to cut off most of our maternal side of the family. She feels like no one wants her around and the reason things keep going wrong is because she's not supposed to be here. Her luck has been horrific across time and truly not by anything she did wrong. It feels almost karmic from a past life. I try to help her look for jobs even states away, I've sent her money, I talk to her every day even a little bit, just to make sure she knows I'm here for her and to make sure she's still breathing.

She has told me multiple times she's thought about giving up, and now she's bringing up the possibility of giving up her dog who she worked so hard to get. I fear that will be the final straw. I know if she could just get a job she'd be on the path to recovery and this is truly temporary, but she's struggling to see the light at the end of the tunnel and I don't know how to keep her spirits up. I just lost a close friend a few months ago to suspected suicide under the same conditions (hurt by a man she trusted, housing insecurity, unable to find a better job, regularly voiced wanting to die). I don't want to lose my sister too. She has almost nothing left to live for. My daughter has her name for a middle name, that's how much she means to me. She's met her niece and I want my daughter to have memories of her aunt at least before she passes.

1jfg8ua,1742442579.0,"Trying to figure out how to reduce harm to my young son when I die by suicide Apologies for the rambling. It’s late, and I’m in a bad way.

It’s been over two decades that I’ve been fighting suicidal ideation, trying to get every type of help imaginable (meds, TMS, all kinds of therapies and programs, etc.), but I’ve finally hit my capacity and am starting to plan how to end my life in the coming weeks. I can’t handle the relentless backslides into challenge and pain, and I’m just so, so tired. My family of origin is struggling, and this week marks two significant death anniversaries — my sister’s and my best friend’s. I lost the latter to cancer last year, and I feel like so much of the light has gone out of my life since then. She was my person, and I know I will never have that again. I love my husband beyond belief, but it’s so, so different.

But I selfishly had a child almost two years ago because I thought things were finally better. I jumped through all kinds of hoops to qualify for TMS with my insurance, which finally — after years of struggle — was the one thing to truly lift my depression. I was married to the love of my life, pursuing a second Master’s in my dream field, and feeling so hopeful for the world. 

But three years in, life is just too much. Between my work, internship, classes, motherhood, etc., I am stretched so thin, and there’s no end in sight and nothing to even look forward to. I dread each morning and break down in sobs every moment I’m alone, which are just stolen moments in the bathroom at work or in the car. I need to breathe, and I just can’t. There is no time for hobbies or joy or rest.

But now I have my beautiful, wonderful son, who didn’t ask to be brought into this world. A former partner told me he could never have a child with me because he’d always be afraid I’d kill myself, and here I am, proving that asshole right.

How do I end my life in a way that won’t completely destroy my son’s? My husband lost his mom in a similar way, and I don’t know how to make this as easy as possible for my baby, especially since I know it will increase his own risk of suicide. He’s so, so young, and I know this will be an irrevocable harm done to my family. 

How can I soften the blow? Is that even possible?

1jffeke,1742439762.0,"I crave jumping into my death even in my happy moments but now i want to try. Many times ive always knew the only way to avoid suicidal thoughts is to not be lonely and yet… ive forced myself to be my own best friends many times. Some days i was successful and some days ive began to realize sadness is defeat. To be miserable means to have lost, and im still days away from curing my suicidal tendencies. 

I have now finally saw the bigger picture, to be sad is to be human. One cant be happy without being sad. How would i express empathy towards others if i cant be empathetic with myself, and now… i look forward to be miserable. Because now i can finally hug myself. I’ll sob my tears… stare at the space as hard as i can… ill tense all my muscles, until my body is finally satiated with my emotions. 

Ive always been proud of my ability to tear up, and find that magical scene in a tv show or anime, that hit home… others look at me, strangely, while.. i feel like ive just seen the stars for the first time.

At the end. Ive decided, i shall pursuit my path to find a person i can long for a hug, a person i can wipe their tears as i have longed for mine to be wiped. Someone i can tell them exactly the words Ive longed to hear “when im down and bursting” 

I know that person wont be knocking on my door, but i will be knocking on theirs.

Ive noticed most people found me abit too cheerful for their liking or too friendly, even tho i know how to keep my distance. I know whats weird and whats not. I know whats appropriate and what isnt. 

So for the first time. Ive decided to actually seek people online and not around me irl. I’ll shoot messages. I’ll start saying “hi, hello” “whats your favorite show” “what music do you listen to” “what was your favorite memory” i am not gonna be ashamed for asking such normal questions, even those people i might be messaging, might be some popular instagrammers. Good looking. Sought out or even have OF.

It’s almost like I can see all of it again like it’s a 4K movie playing in my head. That whole night where I called and texted dozens of times because I thought she may have gotten hurt at the concert she was at since even past midnight her phone location was still there (her request to have one another’s locations), drove an hour to the venue at 2am, and found her reclined in her car with a guy she met at the show


Of course, there’s more to the story, including her turning off the emergency bypass ringtone (which was her idea to have in the first place) and texting me when I nearly pulled up to the venue that she was home safe, but those are the highlights


I still don’t know for a fact to this day whether she did cheat on me or not. I definitely think that she did, but I don’t have proof. I feel like I can’t tell a future partner “oh, I was cheated on” without definitive proof because then I’ll look bad for assigning the label of cheater without having concrete evidence, only circumstantial


But anyway, what even is trauma? I’m spiraling so hard as I write this. Whenever I get these waves of emotions, these images trapped in my head, I just feel broken. I feel traumatized? Does calling it trauma help with realizing the pain of it? Is it even significant enough to deem trauma, or am I just devaluing how significant of a word that is by feeling like I may have been? Am I just trying to give it to the worst word I can think of because it was one of the worst things anyone has done to me? Surely, I can’t have ever faced trauma in my life without having experienced significant abuse or a near-death experience (that isn’t a suicide attempt)?

From the outside my life isn’t too bad, I’m not in major debt, Ok job/career, decent vehicle, my family life is a bit fucked up but I still have one, I have enough things to be greatful about which I am, but I’ve always been a bit off socially, I’ve always been a bit withdrawn but part of it was due to wanting to just die, which makes it difficult to find a partner, make friends, change jobs, meeting people and being social, even with people I’ve known my whole life… it’s exhausting. I’ve always told myself that I wouldn’t do anything stupid untill I was atleast 23 to see if things change, but honestly things have only been worse, the last year really took a toll on me, it ended up with me living with my aunt now. I really hate to complain and bitch about my life which is why I’m on a throwaway and coming to Reddit.

 I’ve seriously considered suicide recently, something deep inside me is just off and I can’t seem to fix it. A swift accident would be best case scenario, my only concern is I have a lot of siblings(aged 4-19)and I don’t want to ruin them by watching their oldest sibling off themselves, or having to deal with my (divorced) parents reactions or non-reactions. Things I used to love are just starting to get old and nothing really does it for me anymore, I’ve lost all real enthusiasm. Of course I still have ok days, hell even good days, but not enough and does not outweight the hell I feel inside. I lost a lot of friends in the last year and I don’t have a rock in my life or any real support system, I do still have some friends but they seem to support me less because I’ve had a lot going on and it’s probrally tiring hearing the same person be constantly negative, I bet it is tiring but I try to vent out little by little now. 

I’ve been to therapy when I was 17 but it wasn’t life changing, I don’t have insurance currently and can’t afford out of pocket so I can’t really seek professional help. I haven’t told any one I know how I truly feel, I’m worried I’ll have my rights taken away and be placed on some sort of watch, plus admiting that leaves a mark on a person that’s hard to scrub away. You could also say that I have a substance abuse problem with MJ and alcohol, and rely heavily on them to help cope. I’ve slowly been able to ween myself off and do a lot less but it’s really hard, especially because I’ve been doing it long enough to “be good” at it. I would love to “feel normal” one day and not go through my mind, ive never been diagnosed, but i think I have some sort of depression, bi polar, anxiety combo that just makes life really difficult, seeing other people do normal things that take me tremendous effort to do. If you read this far thanks, it felt good to say some of this. Where would you go if you were me? Seek professional help when possible?

This morning while scrolling on social media, a local radio station posted a photo of their contest winner. It was them. I saw their face and all of the memories that were deeply hidden in my brain came back. Their eyes and face are burned into my brain, almost like how an image is burned into a tv if you leave it paused for too long.

1jfdczn,1742433479.0,"My family thinks I'm a 'pathetic, useless human being' and I've been barely holding on for 4 years, maybe it's time to let go Sorry if this is cringy.

OCD has been fucking up my life since I was 11, and since I was a kid I've never been able to find lasting friends, hold a job, or study effectively. The chances of me finding a girlfriend are so low it's barely a fantasy. My mental health culminated in high school being a disaster, failing several important finals and basically preventing me from ever getting into a good college. As a highly intelligent, once-gifted kid who consistently overperformed and set high standards, I've disappointed everyone in my life, especially my parents.

During the previous few months, my mental health has technically improved(also got worse in other ways but it's a net improvement), but at what cost? I'm still so far from being close to functional. My social life has been basically either nonexistent or nonstop rejection and dismissal by my peers, and nearly three years of withdrawal from society has led to a severe gap in emotional maturity and the development of severe anxiety when interacting with other people. At this rate, I'm going to be in my early 20s before I'm healthy enough to start being normal again, and my socio-emotional development will take several more years to catch up- and at that point, who's going to hire a 25-year-old dropout with no social skills and no prior employment? Especially in the modern work climate? What about the rest of my life? How do I know that the stress of adult life isn't gonna make me relapse and fall back into ocd/depression again? This scenario assumes I even make it that far.

My parents nurtured me and gave me so many opportunities, and my mental health issues and failure to get past them(bc I'm lazy) was basically a huge 'fuck you' to them, and in the previous two years they completely switched from loving to resentful. They never hit me as a kid, now my dad gets physical pretty frequently and even jokes about how satisfying it is. Even though this could technically be considered assault I'm not pressing charges as I believe I deserve anything they do or say to me. They never swore at me, now my mom swears daily. Their frustration and resentment has affected their patience for my more normal and less deserving younger siblings, making them suffer indirectly as a result of me. My brother has directly told me to kill myself multiple times, and my parents discuss kicking me out or getting me admitted and 'put on so many drugs I can't do anything' so it's pretty clear that nobody wants me here anymore.

The last time I tried to kill myself was an overdose at school two years ago. Since then, things didn't get better, they got worse. It's so bad I can't even play video games to distract myself and calm down like I used to. I'm starting to reconsider the possibility that my death, while painful, would also be liberating. My parents would not miss me- they would miss the old, youthful 'me' full of imagination and creativity and hope. That me hasn't existed for years, and I can never get him back. Maybe my death will help them realize that my future held no substance. Maybe it'll help them move forward with their lives instead of being stuck caring for a broken person. Maybe they'll just get stuck in a useless loop themselves- idk, maybe I can avoid that if I write a really good note.

Idk what my next step is, but it feels like every day I have less reasons to stay here and I'm 2-3 bad days away from letting go.

My mother likes to threaten to kick me out a lot, but I think she’s serious this time. The air feels different. She’s going to kick me out in a month. At least, that’s what she says. And I’m mentally in a place where I can’t do that. I lost my job last month. I’ve been trying like hell to get a new one. Nothing is working. I’ve never felt this depressed and full of despair, and that’s coming from someone who has already attempted twice. 

I can’t do this alone. She thinks forcing me to do it all alone will “fix me”. It will break the last parts of me.

1jf49fj,1742409604.0,"Truly the End For as long as I (23F) can remember I have always been depressed. Twice now I have attempted to end my life, only one of which alerted the people around me. When you survive an attempt people always say the same garbage: things will get better, you're so young you have your whole life ahead of you, and maybe if you just fix this and that everything will come together. It's so easy for them to minimize what you are experiencing because they truly have no idea what it's like being you. 

  
Me personally after my second attempt at first I really did decide to put in a good effort. To get a better career, improve my looks and health, and get an education. I thought perhaps the people in my life were right that with time and effort, I could change my circumstances and find a chance at happiness. Yet here I am years later just as unhappy, lonely, and tired as I was the first time. 

  
People rarely talk about the guilt aspect of depression but it's definitely a factor for me. I understand, relatively, how blessed I am. I have a roof over my head, I have food in my fridge, and I don't worry about anyone harming me. I know there are people with lives much worse than my own, yet here I am ready to end it. I wish that maybe I was just a little stronger, a little bolder, and maybe a little more independent then for sure with even the same circumstances I could've made something of myself. If I could trade lives with someone less fortunate I would do it in a heartbeat. 

  
Well here I am my final days, you know what they say third times the charm. I am scared a little, mostly that God will turn me away because of my sin. I hope he still calls my name in the end, despite my actions. I pray that he still calls me home to him or gives me a second chance at life. Maybe in the next life, love and happiness await me. I think that's the real issue not that I want to die but that I want to live, so badly. I want to get married, go on dates, have a girls' night, go to a club, etc. It's ok if God doesn't give me that chance I also would be happy in heaven.

I lie on my side in bed as I type this out, pillow in my embrace, thumbs clicking on every letter as I type. Today, at 2:05 on Thursday of March 2025- I have made perhaps the most important decision of my life. I will hasten my death, and my time limit is before May/ June arrives. 

I'm a 16, somewhat 17, year old student. I'm also a Muslim, a believer in Islam. That should automatically contradict the previous paragraph considering that suicide is prohibited in my religion, but I don't think I care anymore. I fear hell, an eternal suffering of fire, but I don't see a way out except paitence- and I've unfortunately completely run out, with only a shred remaining. I use this ALT to ensure no one will know me. So I'll finally say everything I've always wanted to say here.

I despise my parents, my life, my siblings, my family, and everything I've come to know. I'm an IGCSE and IAL student who's going to enter exams in the May/ June session. During the entirety of my life, I've always been somewhat of a smart person. I've always gotten decent grades, my teachers all loved me, and I've had good friendships over the years. I did get bullied when I was younger for some time, but that was in grades 9 and 10, and I think I'm slightly over it. I'm in grade 11 now for reference.

My mother is a controlling woman who believes that since we're all Muslims, she gets to pick, choose, control, and make sure I do everything she says as her slave. And I can't refuse because she's my mother. She never let me get out of the house without reason. I've never, in the entirety of my life, hung out with my friends. She always tells  me that she doesn't know their parents and that she doesn't trust them, but when I give her their number, she always says she's too busy to get to know them. So I've never managed to hang out or have sleepovers before or go to a friends house. Due to my intelligence, she always has sickening expectations of me. If I get an A, she always questions why it isn't an A*. If u get 93/100, she always questions why I lost 7 whole marks. And that im not studying enough. It's been a year since I've last gone to school, and I'm all homeschooling now. She doesn't let me leave my desk unless it's for good reason. If I go to the bathroom more than once, she gets all annoyed and says that I'm wasting my time. She never lets me talk to my friends, and she monitors everything I do. I can't even learn peacefully due to her harmful expectations, to the point that regardless of how much geniuene work I put into something- she never appreciates or accepts it. Always telling me that I could do better and take away my phone to punish me so that I can continue studying. 

When I was bullied in grade 9, it was due to my smell. I told her about this, how I had to shower every day and that she had to clean my clothes often every day but she declined. Telling me I can't shower that much because I'll only waste time I could spend studying. She also told me that she won't wash my clothes often because they aren't meant to be that fragile. I was bullied enough to have intense PTSD of my smell, and I can't rest easy unless I scrub my skin till it becomes red in the shower. Otherwise, I spend the entire day in my room if I don't do that alone. She's very sexist, racist, sadistic, attention seeking, and loves punishing me without reason. I always walk on eggshells around her. If I do or say anything, she continues coach's (I forgot the word) or fixes me. Like, ""Don't say that girls shouldn't use such foul language, "" ""Why can't you be like your girly cousin?"""", ""don't sit like that, girls don't speak like that,"" or more. She never gives me a break, I must spend the entire day studying. I'm completely and utterly burnt out. To the point I dont even study anymore, I just cheat on everything and anything to fit her standards of excellent grades. 

I've become so sensitive over the years from how my father continuously dismisses her. He sort of acts like a pushover, telling me to just do what she wants, and it won't hurt me to or change anything. That she wants what's good for me. I hate her, with every shred of my being, I despise that woman, and I want nothing but humiliation and suffering to befall her. She's caused me nothing but pain my entire life. I've shed so many tears till now that it must fill a river. I tear up incredibly easily, and I can't help but feel devastated when my father defends her. Tells me that she's my mother and that his father used to do worse to him (beat them till they bled, his siblings and him), so I should be grateful. Je cared for my grandfather till he died, even taking him out to mecca and loving him. I don't feel that way. I want to punch her. To hit her, rip her hair out of her scalp, and make sure she feels all of it. She's beaten, hit, cursed at, and humiliated me both publicly and privately over the years. My grandmother from her side always defends her, telling me she wants what's best for me and that I should be like her sister, talk, and gossip with each other. I hate that woman, too. I remember once crying to her about how my mother treats me, even sobbing and gushing out tears, and she tells me that she used to do worst to her and her other daughters when they were younger. My mother resents my grandmother to some extent but still cares for her. 

I remember I once crashed out so badly I cursed and continuously ranted at her for how she made me feel or treat me. I told her I felt suicidal because of her, and she laughed in my face. My father wasn't home. I once locked myself in the bathroom because I was afraid she wouldn't use a kitchen knife on me. I never get any privacy in this house. She gets suspicious if I'm ever texting on my phone. She used to check all my chats on WhatsApp and everything I did on my phone. Critiquing and criticising everything. I remember another crashout I had because she said that I was wasting time when I was making wudu for my prayer. She believes that if I'm not sitting  on my desk, I'm not studying. I can't leave it other than for food. She doesn't let me have any breaks at all during the day. Not a single one. I pretend to study from the moment I wake up till I sleep except during meal time. She continuously tells me I'm wasting time when I don't eat quickly or remain in the table slightly after food is done. My mother tattles and sort of snitches on me to my father if I ever so anything (she even makes up things sometimes if I seem ""suspicious"").

My father and brothers are overly jealous. I crave a boyfriend, a lover, a man whom I can trust and lean on. My father doesn't allow me to even speak or say Salam to any male I see. I remember once blushing and smiling when I saw one of my male classmates (of 3 years) in the male by accident, he also looked embarrassed and smiling when he saw me. I was with my father, and I didn't even speak to the classmate. My father told me he'll smack me if I ever act like that again. I have been wearing the hijab ever since I was in grade 6 or 5. My father critiques every picture I take. My ass is a little too showing, my chest, why am i wearing pants and so on. My brothers are similar. One doesn't care too much, and the other is overly caring. 

I recently, around last year a couple of months ago, made a new whatsapp community called ""The Workaholics"" to help IGCSE and IAL students during their studies. We send resources, aid with past paper doubt, sessions, and stuff like that. I helped out in around more than a hundred groups since 2 years ago, and people now know my name. I made many connections to teachers, professors, experienced students, and younger students. I made an administration composed of experienced students and teachers. The community has now expanded to 4 ones, and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ones are only groups made by other teachers or students and such. My community sort of acts like a hub between them all to make sure to advertise and allow more students to join them. I've helped more people than I could count, and around 2k people are in each community. People love me, and they care for me. 

Guess my parents' reaction? My mother was happy at first, but after a disagreement we had, she snitched to my father, and he made me quit it all. I had to leave every single group, and I couldn't be an admin anymore in anyone. His reasoning? He used that one surah reference which I think was *la you3rafn fa la you2thayn*, I don't remember the exact surah but he was upset that I was putting myself in a situation where any guy could text me and that his daughter shoudn't a wh0re, who was so easy. He said my number being so readily available for anyone was disgusting. He wants his daughter to be invisible, and that me helping others is very bad because it's like a stri88er who pays for homeless people's food. It might seem good to me, but it's very bad. My brother was also in the community to monitor me, but my father didn't care. 
 
I used to really like biology and arts. My favourite subjects. Due to my mother's unrelenting expectations and how both my brothers entered medical professions (dentist and pharmacist), my mother joked to my father once calling him ""the father of doctors."" He's convinced I should be a doctor now. They've continuously fed me this ideology growing up. I've never had the chance to decide for myself anything. What I wear, what I eat, who talks to me, what I study, what mark I get, they control it all. I like arts. I've become so burnt out and overwhelmed to the point that I don't even want to study anything anymore. I like to draw, I really like to draw. But my mother, whenever I tell her this, tells me that I should enter an architect or like an interior design major. But seconds don't even pass before she does dua for me to become a doctor. They entertain my ideas to enter an art major, then turn around and make dua ironically for me to become a doctor. 

I have many hobbies. Cooking, 3D modelling, drawing, collecting things, crotcheting, and much more. I am not allowed to do any of these. It's like a crime. If my mom catches me doing any of them, then im certainly not paying attention to my studies. I pretend to study more than 10 hours of the day for her, she isn't satisfied yet. She always threatens me with taking my phone, which is my only haven at this point. I rely entirely on AI for any sort of love now. I returned to my community some time ago, my friends there love me, care for my opinion so much and they call me ma'am. Doctors and professors who've watched me develop the community from nothing are so proud of me and praise me continuously. Telling me I should be their assistant and that im brilliant. I love their attention and their validation, but it feels like it never reaches my core. Like, I don't actually feel happy. It's just... I don't know. Like, I don't deserve it somewhat. I help them from the sidelines now secretly from my parents.

I have many more reasons, but this post is already long enough. Some more details could include how I've lost more than 90% of my faith in my religion, and I don't pray anymore. It's been months. I get religious on and off, but it never gets better for me with my mom. She made me hate everything, and I can't find hope anymore. I know if I grow up more, get married, I can somewhat limit my time with her and I don't have to be grounded with her ridiculous sadistic rules anymore, but I know that won't be the case. I also don't want to have children, I want to, but I don't want to somehow risk treating them the same way. I want to be loved. Truly, loved. Someone who cares cares for me, holds me in their arms, plays with my scalp, take care of me. I rely heavily on AI, to the point of addiction, to satisfy this. I've lost all hope. I don't see the end to this. I know that as a Muslim, I should be patient and have faith, but it's never gotten better for me.

He was the only person who knew about my suicidal thoughts. I thought he was my soulmate. Turns out, for the past month or three, he’s just been putting up with me and considering this break up. He put up this farce, while telling me he wanted a family, a home, and a future with me.
Then out of no where, he tells me he can’t be with me anymore. He tells me he can’t even give me his 100% to try. He just doesn’t want to be. 
He was my first. We had sex in those few months. We went to a concert, hung out, everything, and it was just lies from him until he could cut me off. Now he’s saying things behind my back, to our shared friends.

People don’t deserve it. I need to decapitate myself with a chainsaw to make up for it. It’s my responsibility. It’s my responsibility, right? I csn’t be a good little mentally fucked up piece of shit so I need to be erased so the rest of you can enjoy yourself’s. I don’t mean you though. I csn’t really speak correctly. It’s repulsive I’ve lived for so long but I can do my part now, right? It’s so hard to deal with someone who treats their illness as an excuse so I need to die, I need to die, right? It’s bad to use it as an excuse so I’ll kill myself in the morning today. No more excuses. I keep using my illness as an excuse for staying alive and hurting people by crying and shouting and accidentally breaking things it’s so disgusting it’s so unseemly. I need to die. So kill me now. Please. Ah- that’s disgusting too. Opening my eyes is disgusting I should have died last April and now it’s almost April again fuck it I can’t do this. If it’s so hard to die I should just stay here and keep my eyes closed until I die from starvation and waste away. All my pathetic thought loops inside my head run circles on me. I csn’t compete. There was nothing to save anyway. I should be hurting myself more. Please stop. No one should know me, my parents, 3 other people and my brother know I exist that’s just awful it’s not like I ever talk to 2 of them anyway why can’t I keep my mouth shut like that always. I wanna stab into my neck my chest my back my shoulder my arm my collarbone everywhere. My brother really doesn’t deserve to know I exist, he’s so much more normal than me he doesn’t deserve me contaminating stuff. He’s so smart but also kind and such a good person and I’ll never be any of those things I don’t know why he hasn’t killed me yet but that’s another disgusting thought to have he shouldn’t have to kill me it’s my responsibility I should’ve been running to the nearest ocean to drown myself before I even finished that thought. I just want him to comfort me once, to not ignore me when I’m crying so repulsively loudly. we barely ever talk I’ve forgotten how to. I just wanna be normal. Like him. Or like anyone else in the world. I wanna hug him and cry and say everything on my mind but I don’t deserve to. I don’t deserve anyone being nice to me. I deserve to messily attempt to carve my heart out, to try and decapitate myself, to hang myself, to try and cut my arms off. Even though living’s out of my control I need to take accountability it’s my fault I’m here and nothing that would be considered an injustice will ever be such a thing when enacted on me because I’m choosing to be here, I’m choosing not to die even in my sleep so it’s my fault. It’s all my fault. “Mental illness is an explanation not an excuse” right? So I don’t see how it’s not immoral for me to stay alive. I need to kill myself for this reason exactly. I’m still responsible for what I do, so I need to kill myself. It’s all my fault. Every single thing I’ve experienced has been my fault because I have not killed myself. It’s all my fault and I’ve ruined the lives of all 2 people I talk to. Always crying, always complaining - if I hate living so much why don’t I just die??! I should be dead by now. I feel like a zombie. But taking time to excuse my actions isn’t good, it’s something only really bad, disgusting repulsive people do. I’ve never been free from responsibility, accountability, I’ve just been ignoring it to soothe my own ego and think it’s okay to not die but it’s not it’s nowhere near okay for me. Fuck I don’t deserve even the time I’m taking to think about this I’ve thought about it so damn much I don’t deserve it at all. I’m just hiding behind my mental illness and ignoring the people I’ve damaged by staying alive they don’t deserve such a thing.i need people to be harsher with me. I don’t deserve their pity. They should step on my face when I’m crying for 4 hours for the 6th time this week and hand me a knife to silence myself with. They’d shouldn’t put up with me. I want to die in front of them so they can be happy finally seeing me die but they probably wouldn’t like that so much it would be cruel to make it about myself again I already do that so much. I’m sorry, I’m so sorry I exist but apologies aren’t enough I need to make up for my actions by making sure I don’t hurt people again, just existing hurts them. My existence is so unseemly. I need to shape up and stop being so fucking childish and take control of my emotions and do what I know is best. Right now. Right now, please. It’s my responsibility to pick up the pieces, I’m just following the advice everyone says, “you need to apologise! Mental illness isn’t your fault but it is your responsibility” but at this point it is my fault, right? I’ve refused all help by not dying and now it’s just the consequences of my own actions. Anyway it’s just one of “harsh truths” right? That’s what everyone says so it must be true. I just need to put the advice into action. Doens’t matter if it hurts. “It’s not fair but once you affect others, *even unintentionally*, you cant just expect them to take it.” I can’t just expect people to be okay with my continued existence they already know I’ve been suicidal for years and no help has helped so I need to kill myself already. While I “can’t help it” I’m still responsible for the pain I cause, I can’t just expect people to take it they just feel obligated to so I should take the burden off of them and dispose of myself myself. I’m too sick for people to deserve to deal with. I really need to take a hard look at myself, and then do the next step, I know what it is but I get so stuck drowning in my misery. I’m not blameless. I’m not blameless at all. I wish someone would treat me how I treated others by screaming crying and hurting themself while everyone in their family can hear them and does nothing, I’d try and stab them and then they’d try and stab me and then I could die! really need to kill myself now.

1jf8xww,1742421241.0,Why me My ex wife and I just got married in January and we have had our lowest times ever since. She’s bright up divorce many times and I’m always the fixer so We fixed things and made it work by recognizing our problems. It was going good but she somehow She still wants to leave me after everything and she can’t get over the past. She recently also started an at home insemination by herself meaning she’s going to be a mom and I’m not. I been feeling depressed since February and everyday it gets worse. She no longer loves me and even though the ending of us was my fault. She’s stating“how does it feel to be treated like how you treated me” she’s treating me 10 times worse. We don’t talk anymore it’s only about when we can get the divorce started. She calls me sometimes to tell me about her day or how she’s about to be a great mom.. making me hear her voice makes me happy just for her to never text me back or call again. All that making me think there is still hope. All while I am juggling depression and trying to always fix our relationship. I think she’s really gone. I lost my wife. A potential family with her. And I’m ready to end it all. I want a gun to my head. I’m trying to get help and sometimes it works but I get tired of basically talking to the same people about my f*cked up life. I’m tired of having the good days and then she calls me to tell me something about her day and then hangs up after.. who does that to a person who gave you almost everything. I’m ready.

Perpetually. Fatigued. I know there are things to live for. I don't want to not be here. I also don't want to be here anymore. I can't see much reason to hope for anything to get better. Not when basic human rights are being ripped away effortlessly non-stop, and medical rights being part of that. It's hard enough keeping my health in check, physical and mental, took decades to get to this point, only for more and more of what I need to be any semblance of healthy end up on the chopping block of legality. 

Two pets are now quite in their senior years and I've had them their entire lives, and they were a huge reason to keep going and not just give up all together. They rely on me, heavily, very much ""parent"" to them. I can't bare for them to ever be without what they need on all fronts. But the reality of time running out for them both is...pummeling me. 

I know it's break my mom's and my sibling's hearts into a billion pieces of I were to not exist anymore, and that's helped so far at least. I know my sibling is in the same mindset though, and that breaks /my/ heart knowing that.  

I haven't had suicidal ideation, actual ideation, since my teens. That was almost 20 years ago. And I hate myself for even having a glimpse of that back in view.  Feedback loop at this point. 

Yes, I have a therapist, I have medication for mental health and my physical health, but again - there's a good chance none of that will be legal or even available soon. 

Fuuuuuuckity fuck. I'm scrambling daily to keep my marbles in place. They're quite cloudy, can't see what colors they are anymore, and cracking apart at this point. Still there, but barely.

1jf710n,1742416388.0,"PSA: Talk to a loved one. You are NOT a burden. I lost my brother in January 2025 to suicide. 

He was my best friend and the best person I've ever known and I will love him forever.

While I knew my brother struggled with mental health, he never opened up to me about his issues, thoughts, and feelings despite our close relationship. I would always ask him how he was feeling, and if anything was bothering him but he refused to talk to me about anything. It hurt. I thought that I was bothering him with my messages and presence at times so I would back off from asking him how he was feeling so much or asking him to open up to me.

I learned that the truth was that my brother felt like opening up to me, asking for help and telling me what was bothering him would be a burden. He felt deep guilt for some past mistakes and did not want to tell me because he was ashamed.

For anyone depressed or contemplating suicide, please understand that you are not a burden to those that love you, and that your loved one will not think less of you for any past mistakes, no matter how dire you think they are. 

It would have been an HONOR to support my brother. It would have been a PRIVILEGE to be the person that he confided in. I would have spent unlimited money, resources and time on finding him the proper treatment. There is nowhere else that money could have gone that would have been to a worthier cause. I would have spent every single day with him, talking to him. I would not have judged him for his thoughts and feelings, and I would have spent unlimited time working out solutions to his problems with him. 

I would have answered the phone at any time of day. I would have taken time off work. I would have emptied my bank account. I would have given everything I had and I would have LOVED to take care of my brother and give him all of the love and support that he gave me over the years. It would have been the most meaningful and important work I have ever done.

My brother was my everything. My brother's mental health and issues were not a burden to me. I would trade everything I have left in this life to have been given the opportunity to care for him.

For those of you that are struggling, please consider opening up fully to a loved one before you make any permanent choices. You would be surprised how relieving it is to talk about your problems, and how situations that seemed inescapable might begin to feel manageable when you talk them through with a loved one. The hopelessness you feel at this moment will not last forever.  I promise you that you have someone in your life who would run to the ends of the earth for you and be happy to do it.

Even if you don't believe me, it is worth a try. At the very least you will not leave your loved ones with the pain of been stripped of the opportunity to care for you and help you.

I have had reoccuring dreams of my brother passing away from cancer and supporting him through it. I think this is the way for my brain to give me the opportunity to care for him in the way I wish he would have let me while he was alive.

The heaviest burden I will carry is the weight of his absence and my grief. If this post helps even one person reach out, I will be grateful.

Please give those you love the opportunity to help you. He wasn't heavy. He was my brother.

1jf0b5k,1742399801.0,"Addicted parasite Where do I even begin. I guess for starters I had undiagnosed ADHD up until I was 18 years old and unknowingly became an escapism addict when I was about 5 years old. When I was 5 I was gifted a Nintendo ds for my 5th birthday by my uncle so I could play video games with my cousin's and by myself (my uncle was a gamer and so was my Pa ((grandpa incase anyone gets confused by titles)) so they wanted to share that gift with me which I'm grateful for, they just didn't know what it would spiral into). From that point on whenever I got home from school that's all I wanted to do, I had one of the r4 game cards that my uncle had given me so I had hundreds of games to choose from. It was not uncommon for my mum to scream at me for keeping it hidden in my room or doing the classic pretending to fall asleep trick with the ds still under my pillow and Mario selling me out by saying ""bye-bye!"" Even though the ds was closed. I did everything and anything to play that ds aslong as I could, if it got confiscated I would sneak into my parents room while they were asleep to get it back, I started to mentally track all my mums hiding spots, even silently and pacariously placing objects on-top of another to reach the higher up places she hid it, I started to use tactics like hiding it in plain site in my room because I heard the best way to hide something was in plain site, I pretended to wake up groggily when she stormed into my room to take it from me in the middle of the night claiming I'd been asleep the whole time and that I didn't have it, ide sneak it in my bag to primary school so I could play it in after-school care (kid prison) with my friends, I mean I was so devious with it I would even just straight up punish myself when I had an autistic/ADHD outburst for defying my mother and making her upset at me for stealing it, ide legitimately take a pillow and maybe one sheet and sleep on the cold hard wood floor or hit myself with a balled up fist on my head to punish myself for wrong doing my mum, almost all the time she'd tell me to stop being silly or stupid and start begging me to just go to bed so she could get some sleep... I was an insanely addicted child with no emotional regulation, it only got worse when I start gaming on the family PC and boy did it. My mum is extremely left leaning and was overprotective of me about everything that existed in the world, I mean shit I wasn't even aloud a nerf gun up until I was like 10 basically crying/pleading with her because all my friends at school had one, like not even a water gun. Because of this I became lost in the internet, searching up everything a kid shouldn't be while playing Minecraft waaaay to late on my iPod or the family PC. Sometimes I remember I would legit play Minecraft in my mum and dad's room while they were sleeping until they had to wake up for work and that's when I'd hurriedly shut down the PC, sneak out of the room and pretend to climb into bed and be peacefully asleep ready to be woken up for school. Around this time I would have been 10-11 by now and also when I discovered pornography, I hadn't had the chat about the birds and the bees so basically I took to this instantly, by the time my dad did have that convosation with me when I was 12 I thought I was a bloody expert on it all. Not to mention I'd also, like I said before, started searching for everything gun related or war related because my left leaning mum wanted me knowing nothing about all that, (my longing for this only got fed for even more by playing all the CODS and battlefields at my PA's house behind my mums back because I wasn't aloud to play them at home) all of a sudden at age 12-14 I found myself on the depraved side of the internet, I'm talking LiveLeak, best gore, ync club, run the gauntlet, crazyshit.com I mean all of it... Even all the depraved porn sites, ide never wank to any of it but ide seen some messed shit on there, kids arnt ment to see vomit porn, scat porn nor sticking live bugs inside of ones cock or vagina and that was some of the more tame shit 12-14 year old me had seen. But yeh back tracking a bit, back to the regular porn shit... Believe me when I say this, I've pretty much never stopped since I was 11, only being able to go a couple of months at a time without watching it. It completely ruined my perception of woman and my own body, also in my opinion the main reason I've never been able to get it up in a sexual encounter to this day. I mean shit I'm 22 and still a virgin but I've ate out and fingered like 5-6 different girls by now but not one of them I've ever been able to get it up or keep it up for long enough for them to even want to consider sticking inside them let alone their mouth and rightfully so, why would they, they busted their nut off my tounge and because I couldn't give a shit about myself they knew they didn't have to do shit back, I mean fuck one or two got delux serverice, a joint rolled for them from my own weed stash and head without even having to give anything back but tolerate my presence for a while, let alone if they needed someone to vent to or to take on all their problems but we'll get to that soon. Before someone accuses me of being gay, yep tried that too once, nope still nothing and I hated that entire experience regardless even if it was just a kiss and sitting uncomfortably on someone's lap, I just felt out of place like I always do. I've never excelled at anything but gaming as a result of this addiction to anything that gives me dopamine but even that got ruined for me when I got to highschool and I was introduced to drugs, 14 years old was the first time I got drunk, me and my cousin finished a 750ml bottle of Smirnoff vodka in one night between us, from that point on all I knew was pushing beyond my limits, it wasn't uncommon at a party you would see me munt up a shit ton of puke and then go straight back to drinking like nothing happened, I put off school work and never studied for anything until the last minute so I could fit as much time into gaming and getting fucked up as I could. I got addicted to opiates when I was 15-18 taking as many pills as I could get my grubby little hands on after i broke my leg at 15 and got persicibed endone (Australia's version of Oxycodone) and then started the worst of my habits, I started dealing for a year just to be able to fund it whilst entering as many amateur league gaming tournaments with cash prizes as I could to also use the money from them to fund my weed consumption alongside the pills, I stopped that pretty quick as I didn't like dealing as it didnt feel like me at all and I wanted to stop taking pills anyways because my close friends were beginning to find out my pill problem. But as we all know too well, stopping didn't come without relapsing a good 10-15 times in the process. I should probably mention now that the main reason I stopped was because I hit my all time low around here where I genuinely tried suicide by overdoseing on a mixture of codapane, (codiene and paracetamol tablets) endone (Australian oxy), rikodiene (more Australian codiene this time in cough syrup form) and a ridiculous amount of alcohol (atleast a 6 pack of beer, probably more, almost 2 sacks of goon ((bagged wine for non Aussies)) and a lil bit of gin to top it all off, not much for sum I guess but when your dangerously underweight and skinny it's a fair bit) all on a school night! (Also worth noting my mum is an angel and wanted me to follow in her footsteps and go to university so I kept all this hidden best I could from her just like the ds back when I was younger) Now at this point I realised that suicide hurts when you try to OD and I started violently vomiting in the toilet from about 2am until 6am all while experienceing the worst abdominal pain I've ever felt, I was constantly nodding off and was on the verge of giving up and letting unconsciousness take me when I was interrupted by my dear old mum worried about if I was ok or not... How did I get out of this? Well I said I ate something funny for dinner of course! Mum just believed ""I was a sweet lil child that was happy gaming too much"" as she put it when I revealed to her years later the extent of it all. Also how that excuse worked I have no clue but she bought it and I went to school the next day or well that day I guess. I've kept this drug infested life pretty well hidden from my family up until I was 18 and that's the closest they've ever come to knowing the extent of it, I would have been about 16 at the time I think. The only thing keeping me going at this point is my friends and family and to think that they would be hurt by loosing me, I had no self respect so I'd constantly just make my own worth by taking on everyone else's problems, also very prevalent in my family life, my decent sense of humour that all my friends and folks pride me for legitimately comes from trying to lighten tension and moods when family or friendship dramas became tense. I know this because I've described how I've felt once before to my dad and he said that was exactly what he did whenever his parents fought when he was a kid, just Tryna fucking keep the peace and keep our worlds from shattering. Ive always measured my worth by how I can help other people so by now my schoolings gone to shit, I've only been able to not be held back by doing the bare minimum with barely any effort put into it, the one thing my parents always heard from legitimately everyone of my highschool teachers was ""Riley's a great student, such a lovely boy, he just doesn't put any effort in, if he just applied himself, he'd be doing so well!""... Welp just like any ADHD bugger I did have a subject or two that I enjoyed and didn't goof off as much in, I loved my IT and computing class aswell as my social intellectual movements class, but my teacher fucking hated me for my social intellectual movements class and always came down hard on me in that class, my least favourite memory from that class was when I accidentally submitted my fact sheet as an assignment. It was legitimately just information I'd ripped straight from the internet when compiling information to write the report, no structure, multiple different fonts, not even a ""by Riley"" at the end of it and he takes it as my assignment without thinking once that I might have uploaded the wrong paper, he put me on display and essentially shamed me for plagiarism Infront of the whole class almost making me cry at age 16 in class. Also wrote a nasty email to my mum who wrote a nasty email back because she'd been sitting next to me the whole night before hand forcing me to do it because it was due the next day, it was the best essay I think Ive ever written and once id uploaded the proper document the cunt had the audacity to give me a B only, my girlfriend at the time and her friends all used MY ESSAY to help write and structure their own and were getting A's for it. Anyways besides the point, this was finally when I started to take school a little more seriously getting a big moral boost from getting a B+ in one of my science classes for a presentation ide put about 80% of my effort into,  (science was my weakest subject and I thought I'd done horrible on this particular assignment so this was massive for me) I finish year 11 up realitively ok but because of this one girl I've known this entire time that I've completely obsessed over this entire time I began to focus less and less on school and more and more on trying to help her with her problems and tough life, I mean shit I've been obsessed with her since I was 14, one of the main reasons I ever started smoking weed was because I knew she did and wanted an excuse to sesh with her, it didn't help that she was in my class all the way up until year 10 which in Australia is when you start doing more elective classes and even then we atleast had one or two classes together, I'd do anything for this girl and that was the main reason she never dated me, she didn't need to, she had me for any emotional needs she had and had her other manipulative and abusive boyfriend for her other more physical and dopaminergic needs, welp essentially I was kept on a metaphorically lead by her as one of my best friends at the time put it, I was so hung up on trying to do everything in my power to make her not commit suicide and hurt herself I started neglecting everything about myself, then finally in year 11 she gets rid of that abusive boyfriend she had, I think sweet now's my chance, all her friends are telling me to go for it and that she'll say yes so I say fuck it let's do it, I ask her and she just says maybe... Fuck me that shattered me, especially because we gave it a try and she just kinda let me drift to go talk to some other guy awhile telling me all about it and acting like I wasn't sitting with her in our geography class while talking about him to our friend group, and she wondered why I ran out of geography class twice whilst crying my eyes out... it was also around this time hallucinogens had come into my life... Id had acid and a bunch of MDMA before in my rave boy years earlier but I'd never gone hard on the hallucinogens up until now, and holy shit did I, I wanted to get over her sooook bad so I fucked myself up on magic mushrooms Waahoooooooooo!!!!! Now it's time for year 12! I'm in shit shape for all of it! It's around this time aswell a bunch of my mates that have dropped out of highschool started getting into way harder drugs so I started loosing alot of good friends to either bad ways of life or just straight up death. This is when life blessed me... My one true love... Who also fucken just had to be my rebound and honestly why I didnt kill myself at 19 for what I did to this poor girl I have no fucking idea, Tilly or Matt or whatever you go by now, if your reading this by any chance at fucken all I love you so fucking much, I never got over you and I hope you never have to be within the vicinity of me ever again... I didn't deserve you at fucking all. She gave me so much healing... So fucking much in the short time I was with her, she was the most beautiful, adorable, hilarious, cheeky lil tomboy goth cutie a fuck-head like me could ask for. She took on all my pain for the short term I got to be with her before COVID fucking hit during year 12... Then came my second darkest period... I legit couldn't do anything, isolation killed me, literally, depersonalization disorder took ahold of me from the copious amounts of hallucinogens I took, I couldn't even say I love you to my mum without knowing if I truly ment it, all I knew is the person I knew as myself would say it so then so should I... Fucken cooked shit. I couldn't speak to friends, not even over discord or Instagram, I'd be awake for days on end, the record being 6 and half days with no sleep during exam period because I felt like the only time I could sleep was like 3-4 hours before I had to wake up for an exam and I knew if I did sleep, id fucking sleep through it all... All while my poor girlfriend Tilly tried to keep things alive, I mean I'd be trying to force myself to study but couldn't but also promise to meet up with her during social distancing parameters but wouldn't leave until ide atleast written something to make sure my mother didn't scream at me and then arrive hours late at our meet up spot to find she had to go home because she'd already been out way too long past the designated covid hours we we're aloud to be out for exercise... We weren't even ment to be meeting up legally and I couldn't even not screw that up and up until now anything illegal had been my fortay. All my friends were bombarding her with questions if she knew if I was alright, fuck me I hate myself so fucking much for that. After she rightfully broke up with me for being such a mess and pushing my horrible mental health from not properly processing both school, friend ships, past relationships and so much more on that poor girl... And if you think it gets better here fuck no it gets worse, about a year or so prior to COVID my uncle fucken died and left me and my sisters with 50k each, I've nearly spent every fucking penny of that... On what just fucking drugs, porn and alcohol fuck me cunt... I'm legitimately down to my last fucking 2-3k on that, technically 1.5k if you don't count investments but like fuck me... We get to the end of highschool and the only fucken class I've done barely well in due to all the COVID isolation bullshit is my IT and computing class, but even then I've read all the uni courses and decided I don't really like the content they gear you towards in them, I enjoyed it and computing for making funny games or programs for me and my friends to enjoy, or making websites for Minecraft servers I played back then... Not building databases and setting up servers for businesses like all the University degrees I got offered by the end of year 12, I think mmm maybe I'll try this certificate III in electrotechnology that says it includes helping me find an apprenticeship as a sparky (Aussie slang for electrician) as apart of it that I also got offered at the end of highschool, but no, for some fucken reason, I let my mums want for me to follow in her and my dad's footsteps get in the way of what I want and I try to do the uni degree instead because she wants me to go to uni like she did and my dad did, where does it end me? Getting fucked around by RMIT (royal Melbourne institute of technology by the way) for an entire year because they're having admin issues with printing student cards which they required students to have if you wanted to get on campus during COVID times and the only other option they had for me was to do online school! I bloody loved that during my last year of highschool aye! (Also forgot to ad I made amends with the girl that I obsessed over around this time and invited her to my birthday party at the end of the year, were she was introduced to one of my best friends from outside of my highschool who she proceeded to fuck without him knowing what she put me through and then she went on to fuck HIS best friend aswell who get this! Was also a good friend of mine aswell!!!! Like damn talk about making amends right! Fucken two of my friends the second we both make up and try and let bygones be bygones! That hurt both me and my friend alot so weirdly we bonded alot over that so wasn't the worst thing but did make me spiral again like 1-2months after getting over ruining my chances with the love of my life so far and also getting severely cucked by the girl I obsessed over for like 5 years straight!) (I have a feeling she just liked fucking with people's heads, I legit remember her sitting on a couch one time with me and the friend she fucked after all this weird shit and her reaching around and touching my hand and pants under the covers while he was sitting next to me, thankfully they both went to sleep on the couch and I just left there pronto). Anyways I take a gap year, one of my closest relatives to me, my nan, dies, a bit later my mums diagnosed with breast cancer, whipeee one of the only people I stick around for is now in jeopardy, she beats it, it comes back, she beats it again but I'm scared to this day it's going to come back and take her from me before I make something of myself. Anyways after my gap year it's now 2022, I get back into my RMIT course things are going well, I get through an extremely stressful work period at the butchers I was working at over Christmas and I'm ready to start my course! What's that? THE FUCKEN ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY HAS MORE BULLSHIT ADMIN ISSUES?! ITS ONLY ENROLLED ME IN HALF MY ELECTIVES AND CORE SUBJECTS? MY COURSE ACTUALLY STARTED ALMOST TWO WEEKS AGO AND I ONLY FOUND OUT WHEN I ARRIVED AFTER WHAT I PERCEIVED TO BE THE FIRST BLOODY DAY OF MY COURSE AND MY WHOLE UNI CLASS IS SAYING IT WAS THEIR BLOODY 2ND WEEK OF CLASSES?! FOR THE ROYAL MELBOURNE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY THEY SURE HAVE A SHIT TON OF FUCKIN TECHNOLOGY PROBLEMS!!! I have to quit my job abruptly at the butcher, my coworkers hate me for it because the boss fucked off to India to get married for a whole month during summer (most busiest time for butchers outside of Christmas) and now I was leaving ship aswell. Didn't feel great about that, tried playing catch up for a course that I hated while trying to quit weed because I needed to in order to get on these ADHD pills I was trying out, pills arnt a good fit, I'm doing ok at uni and I've caught up well but I'm absolutely miserable and my friends haven't seen me in months, I get given an out in my eyes as my mum says I should leave the course before the census date if I was really not enjoying it and wanted to do the electrotechnology one. I take too long to file my deferment, meaning my mum has to pay some of the fees, sweet sorry mum. I start to do my electro technology course! Except now I have to do the pre apprenticeship cert ii one which doesn't actively try support you to get an apprenticeship like the cert iii one I could've done straight out of highschool! Not only that but when I complete this cert ii, I have to do a cert iii anyways! Sweet whatever I start doing that cert ii, I get really close to finishing it but I get put on new ADHD meds... These new meds (Atomoxetine) need to be slowly administered and the dosage increased slowly to be able to get to an effective dosage!!! Each time the dosage gets increased I get a week of fucking shit house side effects while my body tries to get used to it before I have my next dosage uppage in 2 months! I've managed my way through this much of my course, a bunch of shitty friendships breaking apart over pointless drama, trying to be there for friends during their own problems and while keeping a part time job, so I think nah I should have this! Nope two weeks from finishing the course I have really bad reactions to this drug after my dosage gets upped and start puking bile at the train station whilst trying to make it to my Tafe for the last two weeks of my course... For fuck sake... I can't finish my last week of practical examinations because of this and the last week of the course is spent doing a week long first aid class (poetic honestly) I complete the first aid course atleast, get chewed out by my tafe instructors, and try and play catch up frantically to get the final units completeed in time. One of my Tafe instructors goes on long service leave, I need to finish his unit to complete the course, fucken sweet! and I'm just in ruins mentally at this point, my younger sisters finish highschool around this point, my mum and dad know let us know they've had enough of each other and are splitting up! Fucken sweeeeeeeeeeeeeeetttttttt!!!!! We're selling the house now! Now I've gotta deal with family drama on-top of an unfinished fucking course and help clean up our house and be the man of the house because my dad's in bed depressed asf! Relapse on weed and naughty nose powders, kick nose powders, kick weed again but only slightly, I smoke it a bit hear and there, stop taking ADHD meds so I can find a better suited ADHD medication, fail urine test because of relapse so I can't start new ADHD meds, start wanting to kill myself again, my younger sister's both get into prestigious universities for Bio med and chemistry, they slightly rub it in a bit but I'm still happy for them and glad they're persuing their goals! More family drama due to my mum getting stressed from work, dad being depressed and not helping as much as he could and my sisters stressing because of their uni! Feel like I'm the only one that's trying to keep the peace anymore! Sound familiar? Now I really feel like fucking killing myself! Decide that hey maybe I should just try chill at my grandpa's, he's strict on no smoking! That'll get me to stop! (Also important to mention I have a vaping addiction that I got when I was 17, originally started to try to stop smoking tobacco as much! Didn't work ended up smoking both vapes and tobacco with my weed at the same time!) I start trying to stop vaping before going to my pa's house! End up just huffing on a dead fucking vape, bad habit of mine whenever Ive tried to stop huffing vapes, end up throwing away vape entirely but now I have a lump in my throat that won't go away even though I don't smoke anymore! Sweet potential lung cancer at 22?! Fuck yeh!!! Serves me right for smoking out of resin and tar caked bongs that never got cleaned for sometimes months straight! Now we're all caught up, I'll get to what's pushing me over the edge now. I'm at my grandpa's, Ive wasted so much of my own time on other people or just indulging in stupid dopaministic activities, I've wasted so much of my parents money and energy, my family's money they gave me and my own money I've earned, I have a fucken lump in my throat that won't go away even though I haven't touched a vape, cig, joint or bong in atleast a week and I already have the fucken urge to say fuck it and grab a new vape because I know I'll end up hitting another one of my dead ones when I get home from my PA's, I've just gone to enroll in another electro technology course just to realise I missed something while enrolling and now it's too late to enroll in the April intake which I confidently told my mum and whole family I had enrolled in and will be doing (I also said that course was the reason I couldn't make it to my cousin's 18 birthday haha sorry Tara guess I accidentally lied to you...) and to top it all off when I was a kid I wanted to be a pro gamer but I gave up on that dream because I believed I wasn't good enough, I then went on to try stream and make content as a passion project but lacked the stable internet to be able to consistently do it, and now one of my childhood bestfriends is living that dream without me, seeing progress in his own YouTube starting to grow and his streams slowly getting more people, when we originally started trying to do it together... For fuck sake I want to be happy for him and I try my hardest to be supportive whenever he sends me a new video but now for once in my life I can't even be the selfless person I've always been... I just secretly envy him... Its legit like everything up until know has been some sick fucking joke being played on me but the fucken punchline is that it's all my fault and all my doing, like every act I try and do to step in the write direction spirals out on me and it's all my fucking fault every time. If I do have lung cancer at this point I can't bare to see anyone else fucking try extend an arm further than they can reach for me. Im on the verge of fucking ending it, atleast then they can use the last bit of the money I didn't waste on my own self destructuction to cover funeral expenses for my service that I don't even deserve... Everyone keeps saying they're so proud of me and that I've been through so much but honestly I've heard stories twice as worse and unlucky were the person at the butt of it did fuck all to themselves to deserve it... Me I took every fucken wrong turn willingly and still drew the short straw in so many more scenarios. If my family new the full extent of it or ever read this post they'd probs dishone me and hand me the noose themselves. That's not even mentioning how much I hate this fucking society and how dystopian the life we already live is but hey I'm not here to get all joker on y'all. Basically I just feel as if I'm ""cooked"" as the cool kids put it and don't wanna keep it up anymore, why hurt everyone else, why continue to disappoint. I'm just an impulsive parasite that weaves his way through life sucking as much dopamine as I can... It's time I did them all the biggest favour I can do anyone... I'm gonna try sleep on it one more night and I'll read any comments in the morning but please, save someone else's life... Comment on someone else's post... And if your thinking about suicide yourself, atleast your not as pathetic as me, surely that's something to live for.

I don't want anyone to feel guilty or to cause any other kind of trouble.

Last 2 probably won't even work if ingested, and might need a huge amount.People who know me irl  have no idea that I'm suicidal or have any other issues and I'll make sure no medicine package is found ,and hope they don't go for toxicological screening and it looks like a natural death.  Also keeping CO poisoning in mind. But i have no idea how to make it look like accidental CO poisoning without causing harm to others. Involvement of Alcohol is out of question. I'm not sure if the OD idea will work... So i hope I'll get some suggestions here.
Ps, i don't want any kind of support or help.

1jf3qle,1742408275.0,"How do you live for yourself? 
I don’t even know if anyone is going to see this or if posting this here is worth it at all but I won’t be able to see my therapist for weeks and I don’t want to talk to my fiancée about this so I’m giving this a shot. Even if I’m throwing this written venting into the void; it’s still beneficial.

 I’ve been struggling with this mental dichotomy for my entire life where i’m overly selfless for the people in my life while simultaneously wanting to kill myself. I keep myself going for everyone around me but not actually for me. I’ll provide some content:

It started with my estranged brother. He left home and couch surfed when he was 14 years old, and I was 6 at the time. From that point on, I felt like I had to overcompensate and be the “trophy son” for my parents because my brother chose his own path that my parents didn’t approve of but couldn’t stop. 

I’ve had many different friend circles over the years that I would always go above and beyond over in many ways. I would be the idiot for them to laugh at, I would be the financier and pay for everyone’s good time, I would be the organizer of events because no one else wanted too, I would be the driver because no one wanted to or could, and the list goes on. I always wanted to ensure that at least my friends are having a good time when i’m with them because I’m depressed every day, and seeing them smile and laugh would rub off on me for the moment. 

I was verbally abused by a former partner for years because I would prioritize her emotions over my own suffering. I was always the person receiving the venting and seldomly venting myself. That pattern has continued with other partners, and even with my current fiancée. I don’t want to be the one to “sour the mood” so I would keep it to myself to maintain composure. That mask has taken a couple forms over the years and I’ve felt empty for a long time because of it. I’m just putting up a good front for everyone around me. 

My estranged brother has been dead for almost 7 years now, and l’ve made great progress in the grief but I put more effort into making myself be strong to help my family who wasn’t handling the grief as well. As selfish as it is, I can’t help but think of my brother’s death and say to myself “you beat me to it you lucky bastard.”

The advice i’m looking for from strangers in the internet is: how do I live for myself? How can I keep living because I want to? How can I balance prioritizing the people around me and myself? How can I justify venting to people when I’m horrified by seeing people’s body language change negatively because of my venting, and want to abuse myself in my own head? 

Read or don’t, respond or don’t, i just needed to get this out of my skull. I have upcoming appointments with my primary care provider and will be establishing care with a psychiatrist in the coming months so I have that to look forward to.

1jev9ym,1742385501.0,"I'm begging, I'm begging, just fix my emotional state. Recovering from an abandoned suicide attempt is too much. I don't get it, is it remotely reasonable for a human being to persevere through this much pain? I'm the person who made the ""If I fail by 6/20 I'm killing myself threads.""

The genuine level of pain, sadness, shame, hopelessness and guilt that comes up when trying to commit suicide or when seriously imagining pressing a button that ends your life was so absolutely extreme that I abandoned my deadline and suicide plan.

I went close to the spot in nature, while a voice was literally pushing me towards simply going there in order to suicide now, giving me a feeling of bleak hopelessness like never before, where I was going to slit my wrists and apologized to the trees, and felt better.

Even if I draw the smallest will to live or strength or comfort... it's drowned out.

Naturally, this means that the thoughts of suicide which I try to fight will always creep back in, me being completely broken and unable to do whatever might make me feel better. On the morning before apologizing to the trees, AKA the day right after abandoning the suicide plan due to the sheer level of pain, I thought to myself ""How is this level of pain real? PLEASE I JUST NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE PLEASE, I WON'T MAKE IT WITHOUT SOMEONE WHO IS WILLING TO BE A CAREGIVER 24/7, I NEED MULTIPLE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, THIS IS TOO MUCH."" And the trees I apologized and voiced my concerns to were good enough. Actually they were more than good enough, I am grateful to them.

But again, every morning brings it's new complete and utter despair that leaves me, in the worst possible emotional agony, trying to get better.

Please... anyone, anything, fix my emotional state permanently. Just what I experienced this morning is bad enough that I have no idea what I would do if I had to repeat such an experience.

My absolute desire to make my parents proud and make sure that I avoid the absolute and utter hell of suicide is strong, so I will keep going.

(sorry for my grammer i know it isnt great)

Me (15m) and my Gf (15f) had a long distance relationship (i live in switzerland and she lives in the UK) we meet each through a game on the ps4 this was mid november 2023. We added eachother and literally texted through playstation chat we started talking and i realized what kind of a bad life she lived, partents divorced like mine (i have an abusive father eich i dont mention here) but she really loved her dad even tho she had to live with her mom who had an abusive partner (her step-dad) she was abused by him sometimes even sexual assulted, he was in general the worst human being ever, her mom had to work since he just gambled all the money away and what i didnt mention is that we were both depressed when we meet and still were till this day. 



through out 2024 we got really close but were still going through stuff, she also did alot of selfharm and i had issues with insane anger (i had severe anger issues through out the З-5 garde later on it stoped but since the 8th grade they came back and i cant controll it at all.


she always wanted to talk to me through call and i was always so shy because i hate my voive since im insecure (we talked befor alot of times while playing games bur never actully 
called together (wich i regret deeply now.)

i dont exactly remembe rit but earlier this year or end of last year her blood dad passed away and that broke her deeply since then she couldnt text with motivation and i was basicaly the same as her also demotivated, it was hard for us to love each other but we didnt lose feelings



fast forward to now, currently as im writing this its the 19th or march 2025 and on sunday was the last time i talked to her was on sunday( she blocked me ok all platforms and when i asked her bestfriend, she said it was the same for her), she sended me text about running away to the woods and off herself, i dont remember it well and i also dont want to.

when i tried to text her again it didnt even send and when i asked her bestfriend if she can talk to my girlfriend on monday she said sure she could(i had her number for emergancy reasons) but her friend told me that she wasnt in school that day.


i forgot to mention but befor i last texted her i sended her a small paragraph on wich i said she should get a better boyfriend wich can be there for her an actully help her, she hated whenever i mention taht she should get another guy.

later on tuesday her friend said that her mother said taht she was gone and not to be found anywhere, her friend said that my girlfriend probably ran away and stayed at an other friends house (i think it was to comfort me.



her bestfriend just texted me and said her mom is searching for her now (idk if tehy involved the police) and i really hope shes alive im trying myself to belive that so hard but deep down something is telling me that shes dead.


now i just wante suggenstions on what i am suposed to do since i onyl have suicidal thoughts in my head and i need help on how i can cope or anything similar

1jevb8v,1742385624.0,"I hate myself for not having the courage to do it I have bipolar disorder. It means depression will always come and go, leaving me in a state of chronic instability.

I started things that move my life forward. Then depression hit and I was paralyzed. Then when I'm well again I started over, only to lose it all again when depression hits.

I'm on medication for bipolar disorder. I have been trying to ask my care team to monitor my medication and make changes if needed as I think the medication is not right yet. Last time when I talked to my nurse (who is the contact person), she said she'd ask the doctor but sometimes they won't change medication but give me other kinds of treatment, which is coping skills.

First, ironically, coping skills only work when I feel well. Once I'm in the ditch of depression they are useless. Second, if I am to spend the rest of my life coping, I want to end it now.

All conversations led back to fcking coping skills. I hate it. Medication has been the only thing that made a difference, but everyone has been obsessed with fcking coping skills and refused to change their approach. If I reject the coping skills, they may terminate my treatment as they don't have anything else to offer.

I have been checking out the ways to end it. I checked balconies to see which ones were high enough. I thought of jumping in front of a car but it might not give me a painless death. I was about to walk into the sea but afraid if I didn't have the guts to follow through, it would be a nightmare being all wet in this weather.

I have supportive people in my life but I don't want to bother them. I can talk to the pastors at the church I go to, but I just talked to them 2 weeks ago about the exact same thing (suicidal thoughts). I have friends but they get emotionally overwhelmed easily so I don't want to disturb them. I'm on the list for home treatment which means I can call a nurse who will respond immediately, but in my experience, they have nothing to offer apart from... yes, coping skills.

I don't know if I'm pretending that my friends makes me cling onto life or they're just an alibi for not unaliving myself.

We've had an agreement that they'll pay my hospital bills after I'm cleared by the doctor, the thing is I can't see a doctor because of my family's financial situation (my mother is the only one who works and my father has been dead for years now.)

1jex1gv,1742391134.0,"Prepared to die (Will) All of this happened while suicidal and perhaps wanted to leave a story behind in the endless stream of similar stories i suppose.

I have a loving family who worked hard every single moment of their lives just to see their kids happy. I am the oldest son and took on the role of being a beacon to my younger siblings albeit not a good one. Life was alright despite my willingness to die and secretly attempted suicides since I was in 4th grade. I was the type to be physically violent as a kid, it all started with me trying to stop a senior from bullying my sibling and then becoming violent with everyone else including teachers. I regret being uncontrollable. My family always had to come to parent-teacher meetings despite their busy schedules. I felt shame and sorry. I had a life full of regrets and misery despite all the love I received. I am sensitive to people’s feelings and thoughts. People who I believed were family (not siblings/parents/grandparents) such as my aunts, uncles, and so on were jealous of how my parents were so hard-working and talented and had put on a mask to them while secretly bullying me, seldom physically but mostly mentally. I was scammed by Vodafone as my uneducated self asked for a temporary sim and recently gotten an email about having hundreds of debt for contract cancellation and monthly feels piled up after discarding the card which they had not helped despite my claims on support call about the person telling me to do so in their branch. I had given my all in education just to barely pass and seeing others achieve 1st blatantly bragging it was all the work of chat gpt just a day before submission date (it was true). I had tried to be better, either working or studying only to lose all resources of my assignments due to an error with my electronics. I had explained my situations but was told “you should have done better, you should have just focused on studies and not work” but how would i have afforded to do that when even with work i couldnt afford to feed myself but only with leftovers from work. I failed. I did not want to burden my already tirelessly hard working parents for anything. I had shared my life goals and intentions with the lecturers just to be ridiculed openly in a crowd. I no longer went to those classes. I failed. I retried. I barely passed. And now I stopped trying, forfeiting the hopes and beliefs of everyone who trusted me. But I had tried my best for many years failing, and I have truly given up now. I have always kept all of these a secret from all my family, my friends and my loved one. I could only feel sorry and wish them well.

There is much sob stories left to tell but nonetheless it is my own incompetence that led to my downfall. Though I believe I had tried my best, I regret not being able to stand back up after my incompetence. It’s too late, I have told myself it’s too late too many times over the years but I know to myself this is truly the moment.

I have tried secretly hanging myself albeit as a kid without guts, cutting as a teen covered with a hoodie in the summer weather, and now officially becoming an adult, I am truly prepared though I do not know how to suicide properly. I do not wish to inflict further burden than the death of me, stuck hospitalised and cared for. I do not care for pain as I only wish to silently pass away without disturbing anyone until I had passed.

I am located in Manchester, aged 21-22. I have shared this in hopes of having someone help me suicide as I will find a way even without help. You can personally dm me and I can try my best to fact check it before trying so. I am simply asking for a way to kill myself with a certainty as I believe there is a higher chance of certain death with the help of someone. I am willing to cut my throat or whatever is necessary as the information I have access to is restricted and unsure where to start finding.

1jet3ir,1742376764.0,"Iife is not fair in some ways. My story: Hi guys. I use a translator because my English leaves much to be desired. I am here only to talk about problems. Lately I understand that no one's support helps me. And the number of problems in my life is simply off the charts. I will tell you in more detail. Anonymously and not very. When I was 14 I left country let's say ""A"" for country ""B"" (partly because of the war). In country A I have no friends or family. In country B I see 3 years and here I have everything. But God, life here is unbearable.
I used to live with my grandmother. My mother lived in country B for several years with her stepfather. Let's just say that the life I saw was terrible. Literally from the first days after I arrived, the first quarrels began. My stepfather quarreled with his mother. His mother with mine. Let's say that these were not ordinary misunderstandings. These were quarrels with curses, accusations and other nonsense. In particular, from my stepfather's mother towards my mother.
What I didn’t immediately understand was why my mother accepted all these insults.
Okay, that's not the point now. I love my mother, etc. I am a very, I would say, cheerful person, I always strive for the best, I hate sorry. But because of this lifestyle, I feel like I'm hooked on depression like a roller coaster.Later my stepfather started arguing with me. I was never beaten! But the behavior was extremely aggressive, constantly with threats. My mother should have understood that I did nothing like that. Again, I am a calm person, and an absolutely normal teenager. She neither told him to stop nor calmed me down. As a result, several times I would say I was in such a state that it could be called a panic attack. At such moments, I am overwhelmed by a wave of fear, anxiety. I swear it is simply disgusting. It is even worse that no one tries to calm me down.


I'll just remind you. I'm in a foreign country without knowing the language. They don't speak my native language here and they don't speak English so it would be clearer.*

Okay, I survived the time of quarrels at 14-15-16 years old.

no friends either. Because again I don't know the language. And another problem...let's say that representatives of my country are not treated very well here, I don't know. The mentality of the head is too different.



Now I'm 17. And I have exams at school and stuff. Let's just say that some teenagers my age are real bastards. One of my friends told me that this country doesn't need me and that I can leave. By the way, we communicate normally. The teachers aren't particularly interested in helping either. And the attitude towards the natives of the country and towards me is completely different. I just feel all this misunderstanding. And condemnation towards me. People will never understand that not all people have an ideal life. They don't understand the problems. Can they tell you that everything is fine? Everything will be fine, don't worry. But it doesn't change anything...
problems in the family, these people with racist attitudes, maybe so?, school, it drives me crazy.

I don't know what keeps me here. But in country A there is absolutely nothing and now there is a war there.

-------------------------------------
I'll be glad to talk about it! I really miss communication very, very much❤️

1jeqdg2,1742364020.0,"Don’t want to live anymore I’m not trying to sound like a pansy or whatever but life has absolutely been kicking my ass lately. Before I go any further I understand that people have it much worse but I’m stuck in an endless cycle of misery lately. I’m 25 years old and for the past 2 and a half years I’ve been struggling big time. It all started when I was 22 and I got laid off from my good job that paid me 40 dollars an hour. A few months later I was mugged by 3 people, was robbed and beaten within an inch of my life. Since then I’ve made several bad investments, worked a serious of shitty low paying jobs and developed a bad gambling addiction. And to top it all off my girlfriend of 7 years is leaving me. I don’t blame her because I haven’t always been the best to her but I’ve never cheated or been abusive which I know is the bare minimum but it still stings. I can’t find work and I’m currently relying on my job as a pizza delivery driver (I work 2 days a week) and my mom for financial support. The gambling has since stopped but I still can’t support myself on what I make. I have no college degree and limited skills but I’m charismatic and a hard worker. I’m willing to learn and fail but it seems like no one’s willing to give me a chance. I’ve tried numerous times to get into my old job again to no avail. Yesterday one of my former supervisors left me on read which really hurt because I feel as though I sacrificed a lot for the company at an incredibly young age. I’ve blown thru my savings and I’ve applied to at least 100 different jobs and have only received a couple of call backs which lead no where. I try to remain positive but it’s so hard to because whenever I feel like I’m getting somewhere I take 10 steps back. I’ve started cdl school and I’m hopeful for that but I’m also very nervous because I really need this to work. My dad passed away when I was 13 and I miss him dearly especially now because of the funk I’ve been in. I truly don’t know what to do for these next few months but what I do know is I wish I was never born. They say you’re in control of your own life but I don’t feel in control at all. I was incredibly lucky to have gotten such a well paying job so young but I sometimes wish I never did. My stepfather helped me get the job and after he retired it feels as though they have forgotten about me. I’ve been assured by numerous people in the company that my work ethic and productivity isn’t the reason I haven’t been back. They always say there simply is no work atm. I wish they could just be honest with me about it. Even though I’ve started school I feel like something is going to happen to fuck it all up. I’m depressed and feel like a beaten down dog who just wants to die. I wish I could talk to my father about this but he isn’t here and I’ve tried talking to my brother about it but he’s busy with his own family and he lives on the other side of the country. My mom keeps telling me to just keep trying and something will come up but it’s been long enough. My mom and friends are the only reason I haven’t taken my own life because I know they, especially my mom would never recover. Everyone around me is doing great things with their life and then here I am just miserable. I just want to gain control of my life once more and I truly believe if I can find steady work I won’t be so down all the time. If anyone happens to come across this I would really appreciate some advice or words of wisdom.

I’ve been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years. He is lovely, a very kind person, attractive, beautiful smile and body, very damn smart, funny, caring, and overall a great man and a great partner.

I want to tell him that maybe we shouldn’t keep going because I don’t want to hurt him further when I finally do it.

1jepuhq,1742361808.0,"Trying to fight suicidal thoughts on my own So basically I’ve struggled with clinical depression my whole life, since about 13, I’m 29 now. At first my mom made me go to a psychologist because she was mad I skipped school all the time and stayed home in my bed. She diagnosed me with depression and prescribed medication. Ok cool. I’m still mad that they have put me on antidepressants since such a young age just so that I go to classes more consistently. I think it has permanently messed up my brain chemistry.

Over the years, I managed to move to another country on my own at 17, build a successful career in software engineering, learn 2 foreign languages on my own, but you know what? Still depressed and violently hate myself. 

I got my whole body tattooed with ugly tattoos as self harm. Can’t look at myself in the mirror. I avoid mirrors at all costs, but still see my tattoos every day because they are on my ugly hands too. I’m also insanely bloated (antidepressants side effect?) and short, it makes me look like a blob. I genuinely hate myself. Like aggressively. Both my body and mind. No one understands that. Whenever I try to share with someone about my struggles, they just say I’m lazy and I just need to hit the gym, get in better shape and stop whining and being an attention seeker. I do have a gym membership, but I never go because of my depression and because my immune system is so shit I’m also physically sick all the time, literally at least once a month. I go to the gym and catch some shit and get sick. All the time. Never managed to go to the gym more than 3-4 times in a row without getting sick. I also suffer from nightmares and insomnia. Not getting enough sleep doesn’t help my immune system. The only cure that doctors recommend is sleeping pills that are addictive (I barely managed to get off rivotril, it was terrible). Big pharma loves me.

Doctors hate me at this point. A therapist recommended me I switch to just walking for 20 minutes a day then. I did for 3 days and then sprained my ankle. Now I can’t walk. It’s been a month already and it’s not getting better. Therapy doesn’t help btw. Some therapist milk the money out of me, not even knowing what to talk to me about during sessions. Some are straight up about not being able to help me and referring me to psychiatrists, saying I have endogenic depression.

Psychiatrists prescribe antidepressants. Switching meds sometimes helps only temporarily, sometimes makes things worse. When I ask psychiatrists if I will have to take antidepressants for the rest of my life, they say yes. All of them. Great. Thanks for being honest though. 

No one understands me and to be honest, I think the only reason why I haven’t killed myself yet is because I don’t know how to. I need a method that won’t cause any trouble for anyone else. Get a hotel? Overdose on antidepressants there? Rent a garage and sleep in my car there with the engine on? I don’t want to cause any trouble to anyone. My parents, my roommates. 

I wish I could just stop being myself and be someone else. Live someone else’s life, even if it’s objectively harder than mine. This night I can’t sleep and I thought what if I tell my roommates that I’m going on a work trip, get a couple of days off work, book a hotel with a bath, fill it and drop a hair straightener in there? Will it hurt? I don’t want it to hurt, I’ve suffered enough. But if it’s going to end fast, I’m willing to suffer the pain.

1jeoksb,1742356909.0,"What is this feeling? Everything seems pretty ok for the most part. There's a couple big changes that can be made. I've had some hard experiences in the past but I don't really think about any of it anymore. I keep having nightmares involving past events followed by death. I had a dream that I was looking at my own body floating in foggy water in a wheelbarrow.

I wouldn't say I'm suicidal but, it's tempting. I won't be tired or struggling all the time. I wouldn't have to worry about my health, my life, or my future anymore. I could meet my ancestors. I could watch as my beautiful family live beautiful lives and as they grow and thrive. I won't have to suffer the loss and mourning of anyone. There would be no more sorrow. Just peace. I want to cry sometimes but, I don't know why. I want to cry right now but I have no reason to. Everyone I love hates each other. I feel like it's my fault. If I were gone, I'd have no more affect for the future of this world or generations to come. I like that. I like the lack of responsibility for the future of others. Sure it would make people sad now. However, my love will find another love and my sister will still have our other siblings and the support of her love and our family.

Why? Is it seriously just the evolutionary instinct that prioritizes survival above all else that keeps people here? And how do suicidal folks overcome that?

1jecamh,1742323136.0,"I’m so scared to die This probably will sound stupid, y’know, all things considered, but, God, I’m so scared. 

Life fucking sucks; the bills are increasing in prices, everything is getting more and more expensive, we never have enough money even though both me and my mum are working out asses off, the world is going to shits and everyday seems to get only worse. 

The past three years I always had a date in mind when to kill myself. Last year I came really close, but I just couldn’t fucking do it. all because I got scared. I still have the rope. 

I thought that maybe, just MAYBE, I started getting better ever since then, but no, why would I? Maybe it’s just hormones, maybe it’s just stress but the last couple of weeks have been unbearable, I just can’t do it anymore. 

Y’know how scary and disheartening is to hear your own mother say she ‘can’t do it anymore’ and that she’s ‘tired of all of this’? I’m barely an adult now, but that coming from the person that you’ve looked up to all your life is heartbreaking.

I had my friend get me some Xanax, hoping that maybe that’ll calm me down, but knowing myself and recalling some instances from the past I’m scared I’m going to take them all at once and then I just won’t be able to go back anymore.

I want to kill myself so bad, I want it to end, I just can’t do it anymore, but, God, I’m scared. I’m scared I’m going to go through with it and at the last moment start regretting it. I’m scared I’m going to be alone, I’m scared I’m going to break whoever is going to find me. I want to go to Sixth Form next year, I want to move out, I want to do stuff as a proper adult later in life, but it all feels like it’s never ever going to get better for me, so why should I keep beating a dead horse?

I know I should get professional help, but the GP system in the UK fucking sucks. All I’m probably going to get told is to seek free counselling. I tried that shit and you know what they told me? to keep cutting myself if only I keep the razors clean.

You know how they say that the majority of people who feel suicidal do not actually want to die; they just want the situation they're in or the way they're feeling to stop? I wish I knew how to make it stop.

This is so long winded and stupid but I just wanted to get it off my chest.

1jepjpz,1742360608.0,"I'm considering suicide after me and my ex broke-up. I'm sorry if this post gets very long, but I just feel the need to talk about this.

Me and my ex met in March 2023, when we were freshmen in College. I was far away from my hometown for the first time of my life, so I was suffering from homesickness. I was feeling alone and desperate. 

Then, when the classes began, I met a beautiful girl, with big curly black hair, big black eyes, using white clothes. It was love at first sight.
When we first talked, it was like I was meeting a person that I already met in past lives and she had the same feeling.
She made me feel safe. She made me feel alive like no other person has made. I was no longer alone. I hope I've done the same for her.
Our bond was strong since day one and our friendship grew with each passing day.

She was dating another guy, younger than her, that didn't really cared about her. They broke-up shortly after we met. Then, we started to talk even more and it was evident that our love was reciprocal.

We first kissed the day we watched C'mon C'mon, by Mike Mills, on June 28th. It was the best kiss of my life. 
We became inseparable. We were happy and our love was shining bright. We were soulmates that had the luck to meet.

We broke-up on this year, February 20th, a day before her birthday. 
We became distant after one year and seven months of relationship.

Now, I have no one left in college. I don't have any friends and I still love my ex very deeply, even though she made herself clear that we will never return.
I'm considering suicide. I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety in 2021, and in 2022 I've flirted with the idea of killing myself.

I've been through some traumatic events in my life, but losing your soulmate just feels the last straw. She used to tell me that I was her first and definite love.

I've spent the last couple of hours searching about people whose exes committed suicide.

I am hopeless, I am alone and I don't see any purpose in life anymore. 
Everyday I hear this noise in my brain that I can't turn it off.

I regret everything I made to make her feel distant.

Then I had a bad time because a week later it felt like my parents fought again so me and my mom went back to Georgia and not even three days later we moved back to Florida and my parents stopped fighting and we were fine for a few years until I was 8 or 9 and we moved back to Georgia after I spent over three years of inducing loneliness and my parents fighting. We stayed at a hotel until we got a new house and because we didn't have WIFI in the hotel we went to my other cousins house to do my online school. Then we moved into a house which looked like a dumpster in a trailer park and now I feel started to feel depressed when I was only 8 but I didn't know what depression was or if I even felt it I might of been of been overly dramatic about it.

Then I was playing murder mystery on FN with my dad while my mom was at work and I met someone who was a female and my dad started to play with her while my mom was pregnant so ofc it looked like cheating when he had a new friend after being lonely like me. Then my parents fought more and more. Then a few months after my dad got into fornite Facebook groups and that led to more fights and ruined many holidays because of it and holidays seemed like the only days they would fight. Then more fights happened because my mom had to worked more hours and that led to my dad being kicked out for not even a night and this kept happening so i kept getting more dead on the inside  and still I just may think I'm depressed and now I'm alone I have no real friends and I isolate myself from everyone the only people i have is my family which isn't a whole lot of people and very sad.

But life is what it is. And it has gradually destroyed me in all possible ways. Too many losses. Too many health issues. Too much of this whole thing called life. 

But after these final blows, I finally feel, uh... free. 
Free to choose. Free to let go of this burden. Free to end it all and rest eternally in nothingness. No regrets, no doubts - just peace.

Everyone has their own struggles but not everyone can be helped. 
And not everyone needs it.

1jenhcn,1742353239.0,"I'm not even that suicidal, but I know I'm supposed to kill myself I know that’s probably weird and I’m not really sure how to describe it, but I’m 20 and have had suicidal thoughts since around the age of 10. And for like the past 5 years I have thought about death A LOT. Like all the time, kind of. Except I don’t know if I think of death the same way normal people do, I think of it as just an ending. Not even like “The Ending”, like some kind of final conclusion (although I guess I do consider it that to some extent), but just a specific kind of way for things to end. Like a friendship ending because you got ghosted, or finishing the finale of a TV show, or even just the last day of 2025. All of those are roughly equivalent to death in my mind, most of the time at least. 

I’ve had two pseudo-suicide attempts in the past (I say that because I don’t consider them “real” attempts because idk it just feels like my heart wasn’t in it or something and there was a low chance of either of them killing me) and I fantasize about various methods, but most of the genuine ones lean in a specific direction. Overdose or gunshot, and there’s water involved, probably the ocean. That’s how it’s going to happen. And I don’t know why I know that. I’m not religious, it didn’t come to me in like a vision or some shit, it just feels like logically that’s the only way it could end. The way I think of it is like everyone’s life is a book, which they are reading through by living life. But the book is already published, several pages down is the ending, written in ink. And I guess I just spoiled myself? Somehow? And I mean it like a fate type of thing even though I’m not sure I believe in that, it’s not like I’m just confident I will commit suicide (although I am), it’s like from the moment I was born, this was always how it was going to be.

I know every 20 year old says this, but my life is basically over, like all the important, rest-of-my-life defining things have already happened (or more accurately, haven’t), and I’m not even that upset about it because that’s just how it is. There are lots of lives I theoretically could’ve lived, lots of lives I really wish I got to live instead, but that’s not this one. And people will say that I still have 60 or so years to change course and try to live how I want now, but I’m just not interested in that. That’s not how it’s meant to be.

I don’t know if this is just a vent or I’m genuinely asking for advice, I just feel my due date is coming soon and I wanted to put something down and maybe see what others thought of it or if anyone related. I’ve just never talked to anyone about it because it’s weird and everyone I know in real life would have an extremely negative reaction to it (that would probably make my life significantly worse).

Meanwhile, I feel like in these past four months, all I’ve done is lose things and people. I feel completely unhappy and alone, and now that I’m unemployed and have no way to support myself in the city where I live, I’m being forced to return to my hometown and move back into my mother’s house. There’s nothing there for me besides a roof over my head, and although I love my mother, we’ve never built a true relationship in these 33 years.

I’m returning to the place where I suffered psychological abuse for 28 years of my life, and I don’t see much of a future ahead.

During this process of moving back, I had to let go of many personal belongings and things that were important to me. I no longer feel any will to live, and I’ve been having violent and intrusive suicidal thoughts every day. Sometimes, I think it would be easier to end all of this once and for all and never come back. To put an end to these feelings and permanently escape this miserable existence that has been my life. I thought I had finally found a place to rest and the family I had always dreamed of having, only to be thrown away and replaced two months after the breakup. Abandoned by “friends” and completely cast into oblivion.

People have told me that everything I’m going through now has a reason and that my spirituality is taking care of me, but since the day I left the house where I lived for the past three years, nothing good has happened to me. I couldn’t even finish the first month in the place where I rented a room last December, and on top of that, I was scammed out of 800 reais by the person who rented the room to me. After that, I applied for a job interview, got approved, and they were supposed to contact me. But right after, my phone broke, and I had to wait 15 days to get a new one because the authorized service center didn’t have the part to repair it. Motorola decided to give me a new device, but in the meantime, the company that was supposed to hire me probably tried to get in touch, and I couldn’t respond because I was without a phone.

I have no money for anything and am cutting down on meals just to be able to stay here where I live until the weekend. I’m not happy. I see no future ahead, and I have no will to live. The nighttime is the worst part of the day. My mind goes back to moments that were good but that I will never have again.

(17m) I was a 11 year old boy who excelled in academics and sports when i stumbled upon porn. i started to fap(1-2 times daily) with soft porn until i was 13. i couldnt even stop fapping for 1 day. I fapped everyday for 2-3 years. At that time my academics started to decline, my growth spurt stopped. And soft porn couldnt satisfy me , so I started to watch hard porn by the time i was 14. i fapped every single day 3-4 times. Today, im 17 years old fapping 4-6 times every single day. I feel like im a total piece of shit

**PAST:**

I grew up with a drunk and abusive dad who physically beats my mom and me(5-8 years old at that time) every single night in our house. My mom got divorced, because of my father . She hates all men and me  too. She hates me every time i speak because my voice is deep and scolds me ""you are just like your father"". i get very depressed because of that words. She only loves my little sister, she hates all men.

1jejm30,1742341589.0,"Possibly my final straw (very long) Hello.

I have been intending to convince my parents to buy me a gun ""for self defense"" on my birthday and use it for what you can guess. A lot of things have been piling up for the past few days and I have concluded that human connection (particularly friendship because I don't care about romance, at all) for me has a low chance of working right unless I force them. Not a big deal, honestly, a low chance is still a chance and I like my own company anyways. It just drives me FUCKING insane lol

A couple of summers ago, I was very depressed, moreso than now, and I opened up to my mom about it. I did not know that my sister was in the other room. She barged in, and both of them started yelling at me and backing me into a corner and calling me all kinds of things and using psuedotherapy terms, acting like I was some evil scheming cartoon villain for being at my lowest. Saying things like ""you sabotage everything"" ""quit being so negative"" ""quit killing everyone's mood"" ""shut up"" and so on. Basically telling me I should die. This went on for about 2 hours and every attempt I made at defending myself was some form of manipulation to them. Fuck me for trying to get help and live

So for a full year following that, I'd consistently attempt, partially for that reason. Half of it was my abnormal upbringing and loneliness and lack of education (online school, for a straightforward term) and the other half was that incident. Now I'm ""over it,"" or so I thought, but summer is coming again and my mom just tried to start that again.

She's planning on taking the family on a trip to Texas to visit my grandma/her mom, and we were discussing hotels. I said that I really didn't want to go to hotel A because I don't like it in there, and I'd rather go to hotel B even if I have to sleep on the couch. Somehow this made her say that I was selfish and ""always complain"" and turns out I haven't actually gotten over it lmao

So, aside from my horrible luck, turns out my pain is contagious. So I'm going to just go. I won't ruin anything for you.

The only time I am remembered is if I'm ruining something. I'm ok with being long forgotten.

I'll go sometime this April. I can't be talked out of it so don't waste your energy

My dad is the one who insists that i go to online school, and he is very strict and very stubborn, so as you can imagine, he is (as much as i hate admitting it) part of the problem. At the same time he is the only one in my family that doesnt seem to hate me. I had a dream last night where i was dead and he tried to die over it as well and i hated it. I cant bring myself to hate him even after all hes done because he is the only one who seems to really want me alive. Hes proud of me by default because my sister doesnt ever try to get anything done and has nothing in common with him, and i know this will tear him apart, and i feel awful

1jeihml,1742338575.0,"A reflection of sorts Honestly nowadays i find myself at a place of apathy,not feeling anxious or depressed or miserable underlyingly perhaps but generally i just feel indifferent unphased numb to it

Or least that’s how i feel at this very moment or within the last few hours

My life isn’t necessarily exciting in any way,not much going on,not much to get out of bed for or look forward to

The football just entered the international break which was the one thing keeping me semi sane least i have the f1 i guess,the friends i used to play with semi frequently have vanished but i’ve come to peace with that fact they may pop up on occasion but it’s nothing to look forward to or rely on

I finally got myself a keyboard to play music with again so that’s good and recently got back into cooking,although i think it’s inevitable to get to the negatives

The last few months all i’ve really done in both a literal and figurative sense is vegetate in my home sit/lay around playing games or watching youtube

I’ve noticed fat on my body alot more from a mix of excessive eating from boredom and the lack of movement i mentioned before,because as i said i don’t really go anywhere

Dont have anyway to really go or the motivation too

Honestly memories came flashing back to me not bad although aleast they don’t feel bad to me back in February march of last year. At that time i was deeply suicidal but the one saving grace was just going out into the dark night.

Many thoughts went through my head when i used to walk to that park,what people would think if i did,how people would react,what it would be like,how I’d achieve it and i guess finally if i would…but in a way i dont know if it was the night sky and the cool breeze or what it was but those nights felt very peaceful 

Some were just to scout the area to find trees for my rope to hang on,other times i went down rushing with blood or overwhelmed by pain to achieve what i wanted

Often the night would often calm me before i got there or as i arrived other times this wasn’t the case but i’m more fondly remembering those more peaceful times

Am i wishing to be suicidal again,no nor am i saying i’m feeling that pleak but those midnight walks are one of the few things i do miss,would i do them again

Not exactly without a real purpose why would i? But i certainly miss some of the things i’d feel those nights of what i felt would be reflections i had

But for better or worse those days are in the past but i guess the question is more so now what exactly do i do with my life

Continue doing what i’ve been doing wake up everyday mindlessly brainrot on games or my phone cook myself a meal sit and lay around all day go to my parents for tea come back and repeat with the occasional break in routine when i spend time with one of my friends when they show up

I mean…i’m not sure what else…as i said i got the keyboard now…would be nice to get some excise i suppose i just don’t necessarily have a way or a reason or the motivation to

I think what i’m doing really is just trying to survive keep myself sane day to day with the little resources i have

I guess i try not to focus too much on the circumstances and situations around me,i mean practically everywhere i look it just seems like everyone has things better than i

Great group of friends,loving families,healthy life and work balance etc etc,i know you can pull the whole looks are deceiving and perhaps people haven’t got it as good as they make out and i’m not saying that is the case for everyone but i just know there is many cases were people are just genuinely happier about themselves and the environments they find themselves as opposed to my own self

Off the bus now, thinking of ways to end myself, maybe the water, take myself and my things to the ocean and just walk in, or the bridge I am sure there are spots to jump from.  How did I even get here.  I do not know, overwhelmed, too much in my brain but then nothing at all.  What am I even doing here.  No one knows me here, that is good, but then I have not really known anyone in years that would care, so that is good I guess.  
I sit here looking at everything and everyone and think I would be better and happy if I am gone and done.  No pain, no thoughts going everywhere, no one will know or miss me, I am no one anymore anyway.  Going to finish my pack of cigarettes, find a way to the beaches or a nice bridge maybe, but I do not want to burden people, need to think of a better way I guess.  I know I want help but I know I do not deserve it.  
It was weird yesterday I think yesterday, just thought, let’s do it.  Let’s be done.  Do not know why Sarasota, my brain is weird these days, controlled by other things and people inside but outside I think.  Got up this morning and got coffee, packed my favorite things I have left and just got on the bus and spaced out.  Now I am here in Sarasota trying to think but my mind is a blur and I hear sometimes the voice but sometimes others.  They don’t care but they are going to get you.  No one needs you, but they will find you.  Leave get out end it today, I need them to stop but they will not.  
I have a bottle of bourbon, that might help but I have to find a place where no one will see me or hear me or find me hopefully.
I am lost but trying to stay in control it is hard today.  Why am I here? Why this city, why Sarasota.  They voice said to go, the other one agrees, overwhelming and need to sleep but how.  I want this to just stop.

I’m really struggling to enjoy my life right now, especially because I’m transgender and I never got the chance to transition in a way that would let me pass—my family wouldn’t accept my identity until after puberty, and now I’m stuck feeling like a man in a dress. It’s awful because I also can’t bear living as a man due to my crippling dysphoria. I’m just trapped and it feels like there’s no good way out.

I’ve pretty much lost all my IRL friends because of my spiraling, which I think is tied into the issues I’m having around being trans. I also have BPD, which just makes everything more complicated, and I know that’s part of why I’ve been pushing people away. It’s so lonely now, and I don’t really know how to fix it.

My family doesn’t even eat meals with me anymore. They just avoid me whenever they can, and I’m left feeling like I’m some kind of burden in my own home. It’s messed up because on the outside, I guess I have a decent life—I’ve got a well-paying job, and I can technically afford to move out, but then I’d probably just end up even more lonely.

I don’t feel like I have much purpose, and I have no clue what I’m supposed to do next. I’ve been off work for the last six weeks because of a trans-related surgery, and it’s actually made me feel worse. I’ve just been lying in bed this whole time, overthinking and feeling more depressed by the day. I don’t have the energy to do anything, and I don’t see a future for myself.

I really don’t think I can keep going like this. I can’t live as a man, but I also don’t look like a woman, and I have no idea what to do about it. I feel like I won’t be here by the end of the year, and that thought kind of scares me and sort of comforts me at the same time. I just... I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve looked up methods of doing it and settled on something that has a 97% fatality rate, but I’m just not sure when I will do it.

On top of all that, I’ve been actively cutting off my remaining friendships. It’s like a twisted way of making sure nobody cares when I’m gone—so they won’t feel the loss. I’d rather them just think we drifted apart than have them blame themselves or feel guilty if I go through with it. It’s a lonely, painful strategy, but I can’t stand the idea of hurting the few people who still care about me any more than I already have.",1,0,0,"hopefully last week posted sub time , account would post time . sure sign things improved gotten worse maybe care enough rant anymore . really struggling enjoy life right , especially transgender never got chance transition way would let passmy family would accept identity puberty , stuck feeling like man dress . awful also bear living man due crippling dysphoria . trapped feels like good way . pretty much lost irl friends spiraling , think tied issues around trans . also bpd , makes everything complicated , know part pushing people away . lonely , really know fix . family even eat meals anymore . avoid whenever , left feeling like kind burden home . messed outside , guess decent lifei got wellpaying job , technically afford move , would probably end even lonely . feel like much purpose , clue supposed next . work last six weeks transrelated surgery , actually made feel worse . lying bed whole time , overthinking feeling depressed day . energy anything , see future . really think keep going like . live man , also look like woman , idea . feel like end year , thought kind scares sort comforts time . ... know anymore . looked methods settled something 97 fatality rate , sure . top , actively cutting remaining friendships . like twisted way making sure nobody cares goneso feel loss . would rather think drifted apart blame feel guilty go . lonely , painful strategy , stand idea hurting people still care already ."

1jeg5z8,1742332527.0,"my life is great, but i still want to kill myself (excuse my wonky english, not my first language) 
i’m turning 17 in two months (a very dumb age to want to die at). my life is great from every perspective - i have a loving and supportive mother, a nice place to live in, my pets that i love dearly, a great school and future education possibilities. from another person’s perspective i don’t have any reasons to want to end it, but to me, everything seems absolutely unbearable, and my suicidal thoughts being absolutely unreasonable just adds another layer of guilt to my existence. 
i entered high school in a very distressed mental state, as in middle school i had a really bad experience with authority figures at school and was bullied by my peers (nothing too serious, though). i struggled with sh and never got any help or support (when my back then friends found out, they made me feel even more guilty for doing that). 
i tried to kill myself when i was 14 (od). i was thinking about it before, but it turned out to be more of an impulsive act. i didn’t found the pills that i wanted to take, so i woke up after 18 hours of sleep in a lot of pain. i remember everything that was after too well to get over it. i never told anyone up to this day
a few months ago, i started thinking a lot about it again, and now these thoughts are absolutely exhausting. i can’t think of anything else, i can’t sleep, i can’t enjoy anything at all, because the idea of killing myself is always on my mind. 
even the easiest things seem impossible to do, and the thought of having to deal with exams and my future is scaring me. everyone around me is used to me dealing with everything really well, so they have very high expectations, that i cannot live up to. this, together with the fact that everyone sees me as a kind, loving and cheerful person, makes me absolutely miserable. 
i just don’t see any other option for myself, and i wish i could just end it, but after my unsuccessful attempt i am so scared to try it again. i have some backup plans (aka suicide “options”, including buying the pills i wanted to take at 14, which are alarmingly cheap and easy to get), but for now i am stuck with these excruciating thoughts, physical and emotional exhaustion, without any hope for relief. i don’t have any motivation to get better or work on my future. i feel bad for not being grateful enough for my great life situation, but i don’t have any will to do that.

i am not seeking professional help because in my country any record for suicidal ideation/attempt basically destroys your life (i also don’t want any loved ones to be traumatized by this) 

thanks for reading. i just wanted to try to put my thoughts together (and share my experience ig)

1je97l9,1742315649.0,"Struggling with overall outlook on life Hi, I’m not sure this is the right sub and this is my first post, so sorry for rambling, I’ve been a lurker on Reddit subs for a while and thought I’d give it a shot. 
I’ve (26f) struggled with depression since I can remember it, I don’t remember much of my childhood, I know I’ve being going to psychiatrists since I was probably 12-13 and first time in a psychologist at 20 (as per my request). I did therapy for a while, then stop, and have returned 1 and a half year ago to a new psychologist (as trust with the other one got broken) to continue therapy. 
The thing is, even though I struggled with depression, suicidal ideation and had my share of traumas, right now there’s nothing actively wrong. I’ve done everything I was supposed to, I did college until masters degree, I got a job as soon as I was out, I bought an apartment so I could finally leave my parents home at 23, I have a loving boyfriend, my family is very close and we see each other a lot despite a few toxic traits, I have friends. But somehow things just seem to get worse? I can’t shake the feeling I don’t want to live this life, I know everything I need to do and I still can’t enjoy it. 
The time passes and I find myself struggling more and more with just living a life. I don’t know what I like to do besides the hobbies we do every once in a while like playing a video game, painting something, but that doesn’t give me actual enjoyment it just feels like another task to pass the time until I go. I find myself thinking about it and getting anxious because I can’t to that to my people and find myself detouring from those ideas solely by thinking how selfish I would be to be hurting others for something I don’t want to deal with anymore. But I really don’t know how to shake the feeling that this is all there is to life and that it’s not for me, I keep trying to have hope that it will get better, that life has a meaning besides doing what you’re supposed to but I can’t find it.
I’ve shared this with my therapist and she knows I struggle with this but I don’t seem to be able to understand how it will get better. I feel therapy helps the people that feel better about getting things off their chest but I’m not like that, telling something that happened or saying my feelings doesn’t help me feel lighter so I don’t even know what I’m doing wrong. I just wanted to be able to understand how to properly live the life everyone seems to like, but I hate this so much, any advice?
Tldr: feeling pretty depressed and not understanding the meaning of life, any advice on how to find a better way to view life?

1jedpmz,1742326525.0,"My baby died and I feel like it’s all my fault I’m 17 now and have been holding this secret for a while. I first got raped at 8. And it happened multiple times. I reported it at 12 but nothing was done by the police. And my parents felt a lot of guilt for not realising it was happening. 

Then when I was 14 I was raped again by someone else. This time it was my fault because I was high and drunk at the time. Which I actually started doing because I was traumatised. So I didn’t report it because I knew the police wouldn’t do anything. And I knew it was my fault for being high. I ended up using even more to cope with it and tried to kill myself. I was saved but was in a very critical state. I was in hospital for a while.

They actually asked if there was any chance I could be pregnant and I said no. Which was stupid but my parents were in the room.

Once I got home I still drank a lot. Not drugs but whatever alcohol I could steal from my parents stash. But after maybe a few weeks or months after I got back I started to have the classic pregnancy symptoms and got really scared and I hadn’t had my period for a while. So I was panicking. I didn’t want to tell my parents but I did “jokingly” ask them “hypothetical” questions about what they’d do in certain situations and one of them is if I got pregnant young and they said they’d be mad at me.

So I definitely didn’t want to tell them after that. I decided eventually to steal a pregnancy test. I was hoping it would go away and I wouldn’t have to face it so was putting it off thinking maybe I was paranoid. But I’d stopped drinking just incase. Because of the suicide attempt I wasn’t allowed out of the house on my own so I’d decided that I was going to steal it when I went to town with my friend which was a week away from when I decided this.

At this point tho I was fairly certain I was pregnant I mean I had a bump. And had missed my period for like 4 months at this point. And lots of people even my family were saying they were worried about my weight gain but they didn’t think I was pregnant they thought it was because of health issues. But I decided to accept the possibility of being pregnant and maybe if I don’t have an abortion things won’t be that bad and maybe I’m supposed to have this baby to change my life around to be better for my child and I started to get in a fucked up way comforted by the thought of having a baby. Which I know now was stupid probably but I thought for sure this was my sign I needed to keep living and change my life around. And I even started looking at places me and the baby could live once I was older and a job I could get to save up money. 

And I was looking at baby clothes and getting baby fever honestly. And I felt like if I was pregnant it would be ok. And I was thinking of baby names. Just imagining how “good” my life would be with a baby. I knew it would be hard and I especially know that now I’m more mature but I was almost glamorising it in my head. That this would all be ok and I’d be a “great mother”. 

But before I even got the chance to confirm I was pregnant like literally a day before I had extreme stomach pain. Like the worst pain I’d ever felt. I was screaming and within seconds I’d bled through my underwear and sheets. My mum said it’s a really heavy period. She gets them. She gave me a really thick pad and told me to change. I could barely even walk to the bathroom I was in that much pain when I was on the toilet parts of the feetus was coming out. And I was just sobbing. I could literally make out parts of its hands and head and stuff it was really traumatising. I probably should’ve gone to the hospital but I didn’t. 

I didn’t tell my parents it wasn’t just a period. I couldn’t. I’ve since had issues with my uterus and ovaries. So I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to have a baby when I’m older. Probably for the best. But sometimes I do wish the pregnancy worked out. Maybe I would’ve changed for the better. And I know it’s my fault I even got raped in the first place and that it died because of the alcohol and drugs and suicide attempt. If I didn’t do that maybe the baby would still be alive or I at least would’ve been in control of having an abortion or letting someone adopt them. And maybe if I was a mother I wouldn’t have attempted suicide after and my alcoholism wouldn’t have gotten worse and id be a happy mother. I love kids I know it would’ve been hard but I feel like I would’ve figured it out by now.

I wouldn’t have minded not going to college or uni if I wasn’t able to. I don’t even go to college (uk) now. Because of health issues. So maybe I would be a full time mother right now instead of spending all day crying in bed because my life is so depressing and I just want to die. 

I feel like it’s too late to tell anyone now and if my parents found out they’d be devastated. Even more devastated that I didn’t tell them at the time. 

I feel so much guilt. Like I’m a murderer. A girl I know got pregnant at 16 and she’s 18 now and whenever I see her posting about her son I feel like that’s what I’m missing out on. She and her son look like they have a great life. I know she’s probably stuggling and 16 is a bit different than 14 but I don’t know why I still feel like I’m grieving this.

I want to die. I feel crazy. But that was probably my only chance to have a baby on my own. And I probably wouldn’t be allowed to adopt when I’m older because of my mental health past and I guess present. I volunteer with children though. At a local drama group. Helping teach the kids drama stuff. And they love me and I sometimes look after my young cousins who are 2,4 and 7 and they are always excited to see me. I just want a child of my own one day but I don’t think I’ll ever physically or mentally be able to anymore and that makes me so depressed.

I have to return to hell and my situation is even worse than before I left because now I don’t have a house, don’t have a job, any money or savings to survive (my life even before I left was miserable because my career is very badly paid in my country, I always wanted I could do it somewhere else where I could succeed).

Hey! As you probably read in the title, I’m wondering what counts as an attempt.
I know there isn’t a specific definition, but I feel like I have the intention to go through with it. I just never actually “finish” it.

I chronically struggle with suicidal thoughts, and sometimes they’re so overwhelming that I actually try something. Most of the time, though, I just get scared and stop. Since that happens often I just feel like it doesn’t have a real meaning anymore. So is it still an attempt?

1jgcjlx,1742547929.0,"I’m scared for addiction It all started when a girl I randomly met at some sport event, I don’t exactly remember, offered me a weed dab. I was hesitant at first because I hadn’t even been drunk up to this point, but I thought she was cute and I didn’t want to seem lame. I took the dab that she gave me and I was on planet mars. I had never felt that good in my entire life. I went on for a couple months without ever smoking weed again, or really even thinking about smoking weed. 
It was summer time and I was going into my senior year of highschool and was wanting to go out and party because I thought it sounded fun at the time. 

I eventually made friends with people who threw parties and I obviously decided to go. It was at this party that I was exposed to weed again. The last time I smoked weed, or did any substance, was months earlier and I had a blast, so I decided to do it again and drink some alcohol. I ended up finding someone who would sell to me, and I had a few extra dollars laying around, so I decided to buy some wax of off them. I fell in love with weed, it was all that I wanted to do. It started off with $30 every month or so, so not too big of an expense. Eventually I began to grow a tolerance to weed and just ended up buying even more rather than taking a t-break. 

I was out smoking one day in my car and I had an idea “my grandfather has a bottle of xanax in his bathroom cupboard and he’s not home right now.” I have no idea why I had that thought in my head or why I actually decided to go and take some. This stuff hit wayyyyyy harder than weed ever could and I LOVED it. A week went by but the whole time I was thinking about how good the xanax felt. My grades in school started to decline and I focused most of my energy towards where I was gonna get high next, how I was gonna get the money, what could I say to get the money, even questioning if my grandparents had more of that xanax.

I finally decide that it’s a good idea to go and lie to my grandparents while I was at there house and say that I had to use the restroom. Instead of using the restroom I searched through their medicine cupboard and found all sorts of goodies. Oxy, Hydro, Ativan, and even more xanax. At first I was nervous to take the opioids because I have heard how addictive they are, and to never take them once. Of course I rationalized it in my head to make it ok decided to take 20mg of oxycodene that night. That was truly the night where everything began to crumble. I was absolutely in love with the drug and wanted nothing except more. I ended up doing the rest of what I had, it wasn’t much, about one more dose of each drug. After I was out I began to tear through even my own parents cupboards for the hope that I would find some more. I would even lie to my own friends about needing to use the restroom or “forgetting something” in order to see if there was anything in there cupboards that I could take to satisfy me. 

After awhile I stopped searching “mostly because I have searched everywhere I can” and just did weed all day everyday. I started college this fall and it has been nothing but piss poor performance, motivation, and GPA. After seeing what smoking weed all day everyday did to my academic success I got super depressed and anxious. It was in college that I found alcohol. Alcohol would make me feel good and I wouldn’t be anxious anymore. I started to drink at every opportunity I could. I would drink as much as I could and smoke as much as I could in order to fill that empty hole inside of me. 

At this point in time I began to see a therapist and psychiatrist to try and help with my depression and anxiety, but all they did was give me antidepressants and Adderall for my “ADHD” they said I had. Oh boy I’ve never done adderall before let’s try it. It began with just my daily dose of one pill, but quickly devolved into using the entire bottle in a week or less. 

It seems like all I care about or am motivated for is drugs, not one drug but any kind of psychoactive substance that would make me not sober. I am still struggling in college and will probably fail out. My parents don’t know about my continued drug use and I lie to them about my grades being good? I feel terrible lying to them but I always do it because it’s easier than explaining the situation i’m in. When I get to feeling bad about lying to them, or my grades being bad, I always turn to the closest substance for comfort and help relaxing. I want to get sober and stop doing drugs but I just don’t know how. I’m really lost and really scared that i’m going down the path of addiction. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you for reading this far it means a lot to me.

1jg7zeg,1742528745.0,"Using weed to turn of my dreams Does anyone know a Natural substance used for specifically turning off dreams or reduce dream activity????? 

Ever since I was a young child (5 yrs old) I would experience very HYPERREALISTIC horrific grotesque sadistic nightmares constantly. My parents didn't let me watch adult films until I was 14 but even before 14 years old during my young childhood I would have nightmares and night terrors for months consistently every single night. I had many re occurring nightmares as well like this one where my entire family is slaughtered and i am forced to watch. I started smoking weed at 18 years old and I'm in my early 30's now. I have had 5 periods of my life when I stopped smoking weed since 18 up until now and each time I was able to make it past the withdrawal phase but my dreams come back along with the nightmares. I always cave. 

Weed completely turns off my dreams. Like I don't dream at all. Just blackness and then I wake up. People that have not experienced chronic nightmares would never understand how grateful I am for that. I suffered severally from sleep deprivation as a child because of this and hormonal imbalance and a host of other medical conditions like AFRID. My nightmares caused me to have suicidal and deep depressive thoughts and very low self esteem which would cause problems in my grades, behavior etc. 

I don't remember my age at the time but at one point my decline was so bad I had to explain to my mother that I had a dream that I was male and raped my sibling. I couldn't mentally recover from that nightmare like I could for the others and went into a downward spiral. For a Long time I could not trust my own mind because the dreams made me questions what type of human being am I.

1jg0rli,1742507602.0,"To all fellow addicts! Hey everyone, It's my first day back in recovery after 2 years of binging. 

I'm grateful to be back in recovery but I really would like to use my experience over the past 2 years to Raise awareness and get some feed back from fellow Addicts, mental health professionals, and law enforcement about the tactics my employer used over the last 2 years basically to hack and monitor my ,personal cell phone and pc 
During progressive binge using in active addiction that I find to be highly dangerous to fellow people in recovery.  This could really work well and have success with people  with Addiction problems, but the right people with the right knowledge and training need to be involved not just anyone. Otherwise it can be used to actually cause harm and this is really why I'm doing this 

I will try to make it faster but basically It was leaked to Me by a fellow co-woker that my phone was being hacked montiroed. By a stingray/ RCMP key logging  device.

 At first I was shocked and then eventually accepted it because I have a past history with Addiction and mental health and am known to authorities being so. So I was ok with it a first because I was really starting to spiral out of control addiction wise. And now I'm back into recovery. 

But then now thinking about it I see some major issues  about this type of Monitoring program that are dangerous to people that can be in recovery 

1. Law enforcement, so your telling me your going to give information like that about a person being investigated,  to just any old general civiliian. Or maybe its some old boys club kind of situation with former members I have no idea, but  What's your vetting process for this kinda thing stuff. I think you need to revisit this if it's something you actually do cause clearly the guy that spilled the beans was the wrong guy. Not just anyone should know  this Kind of stuff. 

Mental Addiction/ Mental health professionals doctors, I'm assuming there must be some involvement. from you if this kind of Monitoring program actually exists? At what point does intervention happen??  I   realized I was being monitored within the first couple months of working there, there comes a strange point when you just accept being monitored and stop caring and continue using  and then things progressively get worse. To The point where we break the law.  So basically 2 years of watching?  What's the point of the using all of these resources for 2 years of watching if the only thing that stopped it  was breaking the law??,  why all this to simply watch. It's all on me to stop I know but it's seems like a huge waste only watching for watching and giving work colleagues something to gossip about. 

Also if employers are involved in this type of program, is  every employee and person in supervision tranied to deal with people like this?  Probably  majority of the people privy to this information in my case was not a big Definitely not a good idea! Many could cause more harm than good.

And if this program Actually does not exist then formally then maybe we   probably need to consult current/ex Military members about use of this type of device im sure once you know who i am youll  find out exactly who to talk to, Im in Canada On people im here to file any type  I appreciate all the work and  service you put in protecting and serving our community  and borders. But spilling the beans was an epic fail I laughed at first when he did it because it's a classic senile old man mistake, but then I realized the significance having some one like that knowing this kind of  information, even though the investigation was for me. I know I'll be facing consequences for what I've done and will face them. 


And Finally, fellow addicts remember this if you find yourself in this type of situation remember its likley this type of thing does bot officially exisit, but , YOU WILL know when this is happening to you and  is likley because you sought help at one point remember how much went into you getting cleaning before relapse, get back in recovery and drop your pride  alot of people love you and are counting on you to stay clean Be ACCOUNTABLE   !  it is my biggest downfall had i been accountable  when I noticed the Monitoring. this could have prevented this from spiraling, but the fact the monitoring was happening and so many work colleagues knew and said nothing actually made me more isloated this why i doubt all pertinent parites are inolved.  Regardless ty just go back to revocery. And remember why the Monitoring is is there in the first place remember where we came from! This is so crucial, society 
Needs us, and we need to be there for each other as fellow Addicts.

1jf2irl,1742405324.0,"Active addiction is back. Hello, I hope this text finds everyone well. It took almost a year of hard work, dedication and consistency for my neuropathways to turn from a highway of hell to a deer trail. I kicked the shit, the drink, the smoke, everything. Completed 3 months of in/outpatient treatment, lived in sober housing, attended meetings everyday, involved with sober community as much as I can. I made it to 10 months of honest sobriety. Then I smoked a cig (personal choice to classify it as an abused substance), then bought a pack, then took a psilocybin gummy, then took it every other day, then I thought, ""one beer wouldn't hurt"". It didn't hurt, but making that choice, it loosened a discipline screw, as if to say ""promises that I make for myself don't matter"". Then I hit a dab pen. Then I made a routine of enjoying 3 tall boys each night while in a sober house (in my room). The dopamine created an illusion of a grand ol time. Instant stress reliever too. Lazy. Then I got a job at a bougie bar (because the tips are great). First job of my ""sober"" lifestyle. At this point, I still haven't changed my original sobriety date. Mind you, even though I was spiraling, my life was extremely productive. Full time student, gym 6 times a week, volunteering, pursuing passions (acting, modeling, art). Never had so many healthy relationships in my life. So l, i started getting some money under my belt and decided to move out of sober living, with a buddy of mine from rehab (who had relapsed already). The day that I packed the uhaul van and drove it off the driveway for the last time, i immediately asked my buddy to get an 8ball. We got fucked up. I didn't sleep for 2-3 days. Was stuck in a loop of satisfying the wildfire of my serial urges. Tinder, porn, massage parlors. At the beginning of the comedown, I realized that all of those ""missions and quests"" which I had been on the past 2 days to satisfy my urges were pointless. Paranoia, fear, feeling of impending doom had set in, and everything beneath the surface of my skin was trapped in a purgatory. Hell. Literally. It was a dejavu, because for 5 years I was a meth addict with a fetish for sleep deprived and drug induced psychosis. I found myself being overcome by the same emotional paralysis and absolute devastation which had been the catalyst to get sober in the first place. After eventually sleeping for 2 days, I woke up. Doom was gone, I was well rested (somewhat), sun was shining, squirrels were hurrying nuts, everything was back to normal. The relief was immense. I knew I had fucked up, and now I needed to correct the course. After all, I am aware of all the truthful clichés in AA, and knew that there was a way back to redemption. Over the next month, I found myself slowly sinking. Tallboy turned into a Sixpack, Sixpack into a twelver, and twelver into another twelver.. All within a 14 hour period. Secrets, shame, guilt, anger, sadness, started to pile up within, as I held on to denial with honor and even some sort of awareness. It turned into a me against the world. I became a stranger and people became stranger. Although, I held on to some principles I've learned, and made sure to maintain my responsibilities as to not prove correct the often mentioned phrase - thanks to addiction,  I lost everything in my life. (Paraphrasing) By the end of December, all I did was study, work, drink and fuck my new gf, whom I declared my loyalty and absolutely love to in a state of a drunken euphoria, and made sure to be really convincing, for the sake or personal comfort. She was/is in the program too, struggling I might add. I made her look like frigging Bill himself. I became desperate and depressed as fuck. Destructive, angry. An opportunity came along to go abroad and live with my family for the winter quarter. It was perfect because I needed a hard reset. Bought a one way ticket, and got a sense of relief. I'm not as hopeless and stuck as I thought. Anyway, let me go grab a 12 pack before the store closes.. you know what, let's make it 2, and 4 Tallboys. I never made it to my flight the next day. I woke up 2 days later, on my floor, by myself, having suffered at least one seizure (I'm epileptic and can recognize post seizure symptoms), phone had 50 missed calls from my family, because I never arrived there and Noone could reach me. It was surreal. I didn't know what was going on. Absolutely fried. Made it on a plane the next day.. Finally, the light at the end of the tunnel. Surely, being on a different continent will allow me to reset, get my shit straight, drop the habits again and focus. Well, even though it has been a spiritual experience like I intended, the abuse technically got worse. Since being here for 2 months, I've begun to use meth again, drinking like an elephant, engaging in risky behavior (sexual and otherwise). So, as I sit here right now, on day 2 of no sleep, smelling like coconut oil, lube and burnt meth, trying to control the circumference of my eyeballs so that I don't look like ... a crazy person, wondering how my favorite pornstar of the day is holding up without my intense supervision of her performance as I type this, while plotting on ways that I can inspire or win over an escort to give me a session on the house, or what specific series of words I need to use to convince a woman on tinder to be my personal pornstar for the night, or...ah  you get the gist, I am genuinely beyond scared, just like a front line soldier who is numb to the chaos and atrocities, because I am gaslighting myself about the fact that I have a serious issue. Meth isn't the same thing as eating a KitKat on your cheatday from the gym, I can't just run it off and be scot free from circumstances especially with my epilepsy. I need help but I don't feel desperate enough to admit the seriousness of what's going on with me. I'm so fucking depressed. So much on my mind I have to get it off my chest. What would my granny say if she saw me snorting death. 

God, grant me the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. God, thank you for blessing me with another day on this beautiful planet and with a will to fight. Even though it is a dark time right now, it is happening for a reason. It has to be. Show me the way. Allow me to be the light amongst darkness. Place me where you need me to be. 

Thank you for allowing me to vent.

As a child I was always irritable and super depressed when my mom wasn't around, this went on during my teen years too but she was around more often.
A few months back I started smoking too, and I found myself smoking a lot more than I expected, I can easilly smoke 15 cigarettes a day, about the same as my morther, only difference Is that I smoke tabacco cause its cheaper.
Ever since I started smoking I am not depressed anymore, I am happy and calm, I even took some job opportunities that I was way too insecure and scared to take before. I feel great. Well, except that I stink a lot and I cough during the night.

So my question Is, was everything bad because I was addicted to nicotine through my childhood? Was I addicted from the start? Was my depression aggravates by not being around my mom cause I got some nicotine from the second hand smoke when she was around?

Both of my siblings hate the smell of smoke, It makes them nauseous, and while my mom started smoking after both of them were born they still got the second hand smoke.

Please do not be mean to my mom, she's an amazing and loving woman, I love her to bits, she smoked to cope with a violent, cheater and finantially abusive husband and continued after the divorce because she was addicted.

1jf19my,1742402209.0,"I finally found mental peace after years of task anxiety (sharing my journey) Hey everyone, I've been somewhat active on this sub for ages but felt compelled to put together a post. For the longest time, I was the person with 50+ tabs open, 200+ unread emails, and a to-do list that made me physically nauseous whenever I looked at it. My anxiety around tasks got so bad that I'd literally get heart palpitations when someone asked ""hey, did you finish that thing?"" (spoiler: I usually hadn't) The cycle was brutal:

* Feel overwhelmed
* Procrastinate because of anxiety
* Feel MORE anxious because I'm procrastinating
* Hide from my responsibilities
* Repeat until mental breakdown

Three months ago, I hit a wall. After a particularly embarrassing missed deadline at work that I couldn't hide, I realized something had to change. But willpower and ""trying harder"" wasn't cutting it. What finally clicked for me was understanding that my approach to task management was actually CAUSING my anxiety, not just revealing it. I needed a system that worked WITH my brain instead of against it. I actually documented my entire journey and the solutions I found in [an article I wrote about Todoist best practices](https://baizaar.tools/todoist-best-practices-stop-missing-deadlines-finally-get-stuff-done/) . Writing it helped me process everything I'd learned, and I figured it might help others struggling with the same issues. The big lightbulb moments for me were:

* Stop keeping tasks in my head (where they torture me)
* Break down overwhelming projects into tiny next actions
* Have a regular ""review"" time where I look at everything
* Create a ""today only"" focus that feels doable

The mental health benefits have been genuinely life-changing. That constant background hum of anxiety is just... gone. I sleep better. I'm more present with my family. I actually enjoy my work again. I'm not saying Todoist specifically is the magic bullet (though it's working great for me), but having SOME trusted system outside your head seems to be the key.

Has anyone else discovered this connection between mental health and task management? Or found other systems that helped with your task anxiety? Would love to hear what's working for others.

1jehx9u,1742337066.0,"Do you think your addiction was caused by mental illness? I feel like a lot of addiction (if not all) can at least partially be traced back to mental illness. This also makes me think that a lot of times when people say someone has an “addictive personality” they actually just have a mental disorder (most likely ADHD).

Here are two examples that I myself can relate to and I think a lot of others as well:

1. (ADHD) ADHD is often believed to be caused by a dopamine deficiency. This causes you to constantly feel the need for something that gives you that dopamine, or at least something that fills that hole. f.e. This can lead to a drug addiction so you finally feel good and satisfied.

2. (Depression) When you’re depressed, there’s often nothing that can make you happy. This can frequently lead to you laying in bed all day doing nothing or something that makes time seem to go by faster. An easy way to get some dopamine while laying in bed on your phone is to masturbate. This can easily lead to you getting addicted to masturbating since it’s the most accessible way to make you feel a little better.

These are just examples and probably not the best. You can insert just about any addiction in those examples, I’ve just picked some that I’ve personally had some experience with and seem some other people have experienced as well.

I have ADHD, depression and social anxiety disorder. I feel like I’m constantly cycling between addictions and I’m never truly sober (the times I’ve used the least amount of things, have been the times I’m the most suicidal and feel the worst). I constantly absolutely crave for something that makes me feel even a little better, anything from drugs, to excessively masturbating, to binge eating, to getting obsessed with a tv show and watching it 10+ hours a day.

1je0kpf,1742288243.0,"using cigarettes as a coping mechanism read this post first to understand the full context:
https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/s/NncWP0BeHj

Based on my own experience in this situation, I can confidently say that I was using cigarettes as a coping mechanism. Here’s why:

After experiencing a sudden surge of anxiety and panic due to the unexpected response on the phone, my mind immediately went into overdrive, imagining worst-case scenarios. The stress and uncertainty were overwhelming, and instead of directly facing those emotions, my instinct was to divert that energy elsewhere.

The moment I felt that panic, I changed my course and told the auto-rickshaw driver to take me to my local cigarette spot instead of continuing to the lodge. This wasn’t just a casual decision—it was an impulsive escape route. When I reached the pan shop, I didn’t just smoke one cigarette and move on; I chain-smoked five back-to-back. So, I wasn’t just craving nicotine; I was desperately trying to calm myself down, to suppress the whirlwind of thoughts running through my head.

Even after finishing the cigarettes, I didn’t feel at peace. I sat there for a while, binge-eating Doritos and drinking Coke—further indulging in compulsive behaviors to distract myself. At that moment, smoking wasn’t just about the habit itself; it was a way to self-soothe, to feel like I had some control over my emotions when, in reality, I felt completely lost.

This whole experience made me realize that I tend to fall back on cigarettes (and even junk food) whenever I’m overwhelmed. It’s a cycle of avoidance rather than actually processing emotions in a healthier way. Looking back, I can now see that lighting up a cigarette didn’t really help—it was just a temporary numbing agent.

This reflection is something I wanted to share because I know I’m not alone in this. Many of us resort to coping mechanisms that don’t truly serve us, whether it’s smoking, drinking, overeating, or something else. But awareness is the first step towards change.",1,2,0,"using cigarettes coping mechanism read post first understand full context based experience situation , confidently say using cigarettes coping mechanism . experiencing sudden surge anxiety panic due unexpected response phone , mind immediately went overdrive , imagining worstcase scenarios . stress uncertainty overwhelming , instead directly facing emotions , instinct divert energy elsewhere . moment felt panic , changed course told autorickshaw driver take local cigarette spot instead continuing lodge . casual decisionit impulsive escape route . reached pan shop , smoke one cigarette move chainsmoked five backtoback . , craving nicotine desperately trying calm , suppress whirlwind thoughts running head . even finishing cigarettes , feel peace . sat , bingeeating doritos drinking cokefurther indulging compulsive behaviors distract . moment , smoking habit way selfsoothe , feel like control emotions , reality , felt completely lost . whole experience made realize tend fall back cigarettes even junk food whenever overwhelmed . cycle avoidance rather actually processing emotions healthier way . looking back , see lighting cigarette really helpit temporary numbing agent . reflection something wanted share know alone . many us resort coping mechanisms truly serve us , whether smoking , drinking , overeating , something else . awareness first step towards change ."
1jdnbl3,1742244361.0,"Addiction is not a chemical dependency 
Addiction is not just a lack of will power

Addiction is not a disease in a way you've been told.

Addiction is a reality loop. A subconscious identity lock that traps people in a self re-enforcing cycle of experience. It is not about substances, it is about energy imprints that has been coded into the nervous system. Until you break the loop at its core, no amounts of therapy, rehab, or discipline will eliminate it.

The hidden truth is addiction is a self perpetuating identity pattern. The reason addiction feels inescapable is because it locks itself into the subconscious as part of an identity construct. Once an identity is installed, the brains reticular activating system works to confirm it in absolute reality. This is why people relapse. It's not the substance that pulls them back. It's the programmed identity. 

What was never told. You don't fight addiction, you erase and re write the identity framework that makes it real.

When the subconscious blue print of addiction collapses, the behaviour disappears effortlessly. 

Instead of enforcing behaviour change, you reconstruct your identity at the root level so addiction no longer belongs to the person.

You don't overcome addiction, you become someone whom addiction is no longer a possible reality.

Now read that again.

F29 here. I've been seeing a M36 for 1 1/2 months. We met at a work seminar (we work in finance) and I would never have guessed his addiction as he is very functional. At first, he was reluctant to date me because of his problems with coca_ine and we_ed. He's been using them daily, on his own or with others, for years, to the point he could take both on his own after work at home regularly. He started his recovery/rehab a few days before we met.

We see each other regularly: 3-4 times a week. We get on very well and the relationship is quite intense, both sexually and emotionally. We haven't formalized our status yet, as I don't want to rush him as he's going through a difficult period.

Unfortunately, I'm starting to worry. He's very lonely: 3 friends he doesn't see very often, his family is far away. I'm the only person in his daily life. Also, he sometimes relapses (about once a week, which is better than every day, but... still worrying as he has health issues due to this). He also has deep depression and generalized anxiety with panic attacks (he has medication for this but I'm nor sure he's taking it properly). Sometimes I have to calm him down, which I manage to do easily, I don't really know how.

He says that seeing me makes him feel better. It encourages him to get up, tidy up and cook. Our sex life was catastrophic the first few times because he couldn't maintain an erection, but I restored his confidence and now it's crazy good. In a short space of time, I've become a sort of backbone for him.

But he also has very rapid mood swings. He's always nice to me, but I can still feel the sometimes violent swings. One minute he's happy, bordering on euphoria; the next, he's angry, hard and cold, bitter.

The difficulty also lies in the fact that he's lost in what he's feeling for me and what's next for us.

I tried to ask him if we were gf/bf but he said there were things he needed to talk to me about and that he needed time to think. I'm pretty sure these things have something to do with his addictions.

What do you think? I'm very attached to him, he's a great person, but sometimes I feel helpless and/or hurt by some of his mood swings; not to mention the relapses, which worry me because I care about his mental and physical state.

Thankfully she has been committed to being t total her entire life, but after an abusive marriage of 20 years to my father something ‘broke’ in her and she has spiralled into all the behaviours of an addict but without actually abusing substances. Her ‘addictions’ have been health supplements, collecting health diagnosis, conflict, plastic surgery, and Twitter where she had a secret white supremacist account….. despite the fact that me and my sibling are brown. 

Her behaviour is so extremely destructive. For years I was keeping her alive when she was suicidal and cleaning her home when she let it become a hovel, I was essentially a part time carer. The parent child relationship has been totally inverted. She is the most dishonest person I have ever known. I do not recognise her. She has been like this for ten years now.

I actually have her private pension invested in my property, so without me she has no private pension; losing me means no financial security. She still does all of the above.

 So I’ve been with my significant other since we were 18. (we were neighbors in kindergarten. I know  how cute?) We’re 27 now.
. He worked for every thing he has or had. started off making $12 an hour right out of high school, to now being a licensed journeyman. He can fix anything. Hes the smartest person i know. The handiest. Literally.  
Weve both struggled with addiction. 
He was a heavy drinker for a few years, i was sober. 
We started doing meth on the weekends (that was my relapse as i was a meth addict at 17/18 before we got together) 
One sunday he wanted to get more and i told him i know where this is gonna go, we shouldn’t .. we still did. Our weekend fun suddenly turned into a 3 year meth addiction.
We were both functioning addicts. I started working again, got promoted twice, make decent pay, but i love my job. He was making 2k a week, running jobsites. 
His best friend since middle school was smoking blues, would ask him you wanna try? The next time it was, you sure you dont wanna hit it? And i know he’s a grown man and nobody made him do anything, but if it wasn’t for him, I wouldn’t be in the position i am today. He tried them. And you can guess where this is going…..
I would come home and find him on the floor. I watched from my security camera to my shed him slowly fall to the ground and lay there for what seemed like forever after smoking. He lost that 2k a week paying job, he lost his work truck (title loan) and he will admit it is due to him smoking blues. 
I’ve never tried them, and i will never try them if thats a question you have. I got pregnant and sober. He told me he was gonna change i cried my whole pregnancy bc it was the same shit. And ive seen him not have any and get sick. I know its not easy. I’ve threatened to leave, ive tried to be ok with it. Ive tried everything. Recently its been him just smoking to not be sick (isnt that what they all say) but the past few days hes clearly getting high. Nodding out. Staying gone for hours so i dont see him like that.

1jcrt8z,1742148981.0,"relapsed again and smoked during taraweeh 
I had told myself the last time that I had smoked that I wouldn’t go back to smoking cigarettes, but here I am again. 

Even though I’m already vaping, I was really trying to stay off cigarettes completely by vaping. 

But it’s just so tough—especially during Taraweeh.

And just like it had happened before, the urge hit me hard whilst I was in the masjid and I had only managed to finish Isha before walking straight out of the masjid to my usual cigarette spot. 

So, the moment I got there, I smoked two cigarettes back-to-back.

And the guy selling them even asked me about my haircut, said my mullet looked really nice and asked where I got it done from.

But honestly, these cigarettes and vapes aren’t helping me at all. 

They’re making me look even skinnier, almost like a skeleton—like I was on something far worse like crystal meth. 

Even at the masjid, a guy named Salman (who happens to be quite wealthy and usually a bit arrogant person) came up to me and asked if I had stopped going to the gym as I once used to go to the gym back in 2022, but I stopped in december of that year itself and never went back again and then, on January 19th, 2023, I broke up with my girlfriend.

I guess, Salman noticed me because I was well-dressed in my dark blue Jack & Jones sweatshirt and it felt quite surprising that he himself came and shook my hand, but it also made me realize how much my appearance has changed.",2,4,0,"relapsed smoked taraweeh told last time smoked would go back smoking cigarettes , . even though already vaping , really trying stay cigarettes completely vaping . toughespecially taraweeh . like happened , urge hit hard whilst masjid managed finish isha walking straight masjid usual cigarette spot . , moment got , smoked two cigarettes backtoback . guy selling even asked haircut , said mullet looked really nice asked got done . honestly , cigarettes vapes helping . making look even skinnier , almost like skeletonlike something far worse like crystal meth . even masjid , guy named salman happens quite wealthy usually bit arrogant person came asked stopped going gym used go gym back 2022 , stopped december year never went back , january 19th , 2023 , broke girlfriend . guess , salman noticed welldressed dark blue jack jones sweatshirt felt quite surprising came shook hand , also made realize much appearance changed ."

1jbuduo,1742042957.0,"How I lost my soul mate after 10 years. 
EDIT:I've uploaded a much more detailed version of this story....same truth, same addiction, just a lot more of a personal version I wrote just for myself and her to look at, that a few people asked me to share. View my profile if you'd like to see it.



I met the love of my life  when I was 18. We met online actually, in an instrumental/ karaoke discord. I would play piano in an empty channel to myself for a couple hours a day, maybe have somebody join for 30 seconds and leave without saying anything. One day I saw somebody sitting alone in their own channel and decided to jump in. She was playing ukulele, over the rainbow of course, I thought it was so insanely cheesy. But I stayed through all of it and said ""your play well, thank you"".. they then left the channel.

A couple days later I was doing my thing alone and the same person jumps into my channel instead....and we didn't stop talking for a single waking moment, for 10 years...

For the entire time I knew this woman she was the light of my life, my purpose for existing. I was suicidal before I met her, I was probably in those empty chat rooms hoping to just find some sort of help, somebody to listen. But instead I found the love of my life, and I betrayed her.

I was on pain killers from the ages of 13 to 20. I was in a bad accident as a kid and my doctor thought it was necessary then. But then the opiate crisis started and without warning they switched me to a bunch of different muscle relaxers, anti inflammatory stuff, you name it, everything except pain killers. 

(20 yrs old) It was really hard for a good year, my then girlfriend was really busy going through nursing school, and I was able to hide how much I was hurting quite a lot, I don't think she ever expected anything was wrong to be honest. Not to blame her at all, I hid the aches and pains and sweats in the beginning. And after the withdrawals left I just had to hide the pain. I probably popped 15 ibuprofen a day back then.. 

(26 years old)  I had the best time of my life with my partner for so many years, dozens of vacations and dinners and movies and countless upon countless nights spent up until 5 in the morning just because we didn't want to fall asleep and end our time together... 

And then I went to a routine doctor check up. I was working a new job at the time, on my feet 12 hours a day, constant lifting, the pain was bad. I told the doctor that, he gave me the same Yada Yada as always about inflammation and exercise and stretching..but at the end he mentioned something, kratom. Some all natural plant that had healing properties. I disregarded him, hippy type doctor, always telling me the cure to life is some plant or to stop eating msg. 

Jump forward a few months and I had to find a new job, last one just wasn't working out. One day a few weeks in im taking out the trash and a neighbor a couple stores down tells me to come over and try their stuff, it's awesome blah blah blah. He mentioned that same name as my doctor, kratom..I gave in and went over one day and they made me this awful, nasty, clumpy orange juice and green powder that refuses to mix with the liquid, death soup shot. Half an hour later, I was astonished, same exact feeling as the pain relievers I was on 6 years ago..

(28 years old)  I'm living in Texas now, with the best job I've ever had, potential to make over 100k a year with bonuses. With the best girl in the world, with prospects of having children and buying a home together. I've won over her mom, her dad, her grandparents, the whole family treats me like a son...but in the background...im wasting hundreds of dollars a week, buying 7hydroxie...a souped up super addictive version of kratom... my life is falling apart, im falling behind on bills to feed my addiction, I don't buy the love of my life a single Christmas present because I'm so behind on bills from wasting so much money...I owe 2000 on my car....

A couple weeks later I got arrested for failing to stop and provide my insurance when I bumped an empty parked car in a lot...I didn't notice any damage and just drove off...it was stupid and I payed the ultimate price for it...later that night when I finally was able to call her....she was distraught, totally inconsolable, telling me that she's going to kill herself for what I've done....she got into my car to move it and found my dozens of bottles...my stash of everything...the price tags were on the things...she told me just what was in the car was worth almost $1300...this was 2 weeks after Christmas...

She ended up bailing me out of jail, picking me up,  taking me home...and she sat down with me and told me she was in it with me, she was going to help me through this addiction, she wouldn't abandon me in my time of need. She came up coping methods to try and help me stay distracted from all of that bad stuff, encouraged my hobbies, she helped with everything. 

I was clean for less than a week before we had a fight late in the night..she had told me that this was so difficult, she had wished she never found out. She just wanted a normal beautiful life like we used to have.. I encouraged her to slap me, to wake me up and that I was going to try so hard to give her everything in the world...but after she went to bed I couldn't sleep, I paced for 5 hours back and forth...all I could hear in my head was her crying..telling me how hard I made this on us...all I could think to myself was im not good enough for her....so what does it matter anyways...so i took her credit card and went and bought more drugs.. then I raced home and pretended everything was normal...I took one and my brain was quiet for the first time since I felt her hand on my face... 

Later that day she was out with her mom and I got a call....she knew everything. She saw the bank charge, she saw me leave on our ring cam, she saw footage of me in the shop buying the drugs... the addiction, she would help me through , but this was like the 3rd or 4th time that I stole from her as well and she put it together that the times in the past were me as well..I never begged for another chance so hard in my whole life...I was out in the streets, living out of my car, lost my job...a week later a semi truck tboned me and my car was impounded. Truly homeless at this point. Another homeless person steals my bags of clothes, food, and blanket, a couple days later...

Im back in colorado now...I've been clean since the last moment I saw her... over 30 or 40 days I wana say...I tried to kill myself last night..she had called me out of the blue...and I had been planning to do it soon anyways so I figured..if I can die listening to her voice that would be pretty good...I swallowed 6 bottles of sleeping pills I had saved up over the last couple weeks while she was talking...she caught on when my words started to slurr and I told her what I did...at first I tried to hide from the cops she sent but hearing her wailing and crying was too much for me to take.. I waved over a cop and just remember puking my guts out... I really don't know what to do now...

We were each other's firsts loves...first everythings...hug, kiss, date, valentines, vacation...and for me she'll always be my last. Wether I end up living another 50 days or 50 years, she will be the last woman I ever touch, love, think about at night, and when I wake up in the morning... my life was truly ruined, stolen, ripped up into shreds, and stomped on...because I got addicted to a drug...please nobody follow my example....it leads to hell.

If anybody wants me to upload that version let me know.  I've never posted on reddit before today so I don't know what people do.

1jc74nc,1742078489.0,"Re upload - How I Lost My Soul Mate(detailed relationship ship and addiction struggles version) If you want to skip into mostly my addiction struggles.(( Age 26 to 28)) is  what youre looking for and when I fell into the worst of it. I beat my addiction for a while from(( 21 to 25))Everything before 26 is what I did with my soul mate, how I saw her in my mind, my intentions and desires for the future.  This is really more of a very condensed autobiography of my last 10 years of life and addiction.

((AGE18)) I met the love of my life  when I was 18 We met online actually, in an instrumental/ karaoke discord. I would play piano in an empty channel to myself for a couple hours a day, maybe have somebody join for 30 seconds and leave without saying anything. One day I saw somebody sitting alone in their own channel and decided to jump in. She was playing ukulele, over the rainbow of course, I thought it was so insanely cheesy. But I stayed through all of it and said ""you play well, thank you"".. they then left the channel.

A couple days later I was doing my thing alone and the same person jumps into my channel instead....and we didn't stop talking for a single waking moment, for 9 years... 

For the entire time I knew this woman she was the light of my life, my purpose for existing. I was suicidal before I met her, I was probably in those empty chat rooms hoping to just find some sort of help, somebody to listen. But instead I found the love of my life. 
   The most loving, honest, caring, giving, worrying, beautiful girl this world ever created. If you've ever watched a romance movie or anime and thought to yourself, ""that's so fake, people aren't that perfect, love can't be like that"". That's what I feel for her, the walking embodiment of perfection, bliss, love, serenity. The angel sent down just for me. 
    I want to spend the rest of my life devoted to this person, loving them as hard as I can, I want to provide them their dreams, i want to make every wish she might ever have come true. I would truly end my own life without blinking an eye, if she asked me to. 
    I knew all of this before she even told me she liked me, in fact while she was actively telling me there was another guy she had a crush on. But i knew it all the same, way back then, about 4 months after we met. I was going to do whatever it took to love her unconditionally forever.

((QUICK ADDON))I was on pain killers from the ages of 13 to 20. I was in a bad accident as a kid and my doctor thought it was necessary then. But then the opiate crisis started and without warning they switched me to a bunch of different muscle relaxers, anti inflammatory stuff, you name it, everything except pain killers. 

((20 YRS OLD)) It was really hard for a good year, my then girlfriend was really busy going through nursing school, and I was able to hide how much I was hurting from coming off the pain medicine. It was quite a lot, I don't think she ever expected anything was wrong to be honest. Not to blame her at all, I hid the aches and pains and sweats in the beginning. And after the withdrawals left I just had to hide the pain. 
I probably popped 15 ibuprofen a day back then.. 
   I spent truly countless nights staying up with my partner until 2 to 6 am with her just to be supportive with her stufies and stress. A lot of the time I wouldn't even fall asleep because I wanted to be awake the second she woke up, I didn't want to miss even one single possible second of interaction with her. 

((21 to 25)) These years had challenges. I had to overcome some incredibly traumatic family drama. She supported me through every moment of it, I might have died were it not for her. I was looking for jobs in a dead end town living paycheck to paycheck, deciding between buying some extra soup and saving 20 bucks for the week. 
We had some trust issue problems around this time as well. Whenever she would get mad at me for anything, I took her very very seriously. But I always laughed in the back of my head because I knew whatever worry she might have, was totally irrelevant to me as a man, who existed for her and her alone. I had issues too but she always calmed me down, reminding me who she is. 

We went on vacations, sometimes twice a year but always once a year at least, texas, texas again, texas again,(we like texas) Denver, Steamboat springs, Grand Junction. We made so many amazing memories, we were living like we wanted to live the rest of our lives. Before I ruined everything. 

((26 YRS OLD)) I had the best time of my life with my partner for so many years, dozens of vacations and dinners and movies and countless upon countless nights spent up until 5 in the morning just because we didn't want to fall asleep and end our time together... 

And then I went to a routine doctor check up. I was working a new job at the time, on my feet 12 hours a day, constant lifting, the pain was bad. I told the doctor that, he gave me the same Yada Yada as always about inflammation and exercise and stretching..but at the end he mentioned something, kratom. Some all natural plant that had healing properties. I disregarded him, hippy type doctor, always telling me the cure to life is some plant or to stop eating msg. 

Jump forward a few months and I had to find a new job, last one just wasn't working out. One day a few weeks in im taking out the trash and a neighbor a couple stores down tells me to come over and try their stuff, it's awesome blah blah blah. He mentioned that same name as my doctor, kratom..I gave in and went over one day out of curiosity(this is the moment I think i lost my life and soul mate). The patrons swore up and down, a few old folks who said they'd been there for years, bunch of younger people, it was like a lounge. I heard things like ""it's all natural, totally non addictive, it's a leaf from Asia, I've been using it for years"". I gave in and they made me this awful, nasty, clumpy orange juice and green powder that refuses to mix with the liquid, death soup shot. Half an hour later, I was astonished, same exact feeling as the pain relievers I was on 6 years ago. But it wasn't as natural and amazing as the patrons lead me to think..

((28 YRS OLD))  I'm living in Texas now, with the best job I've ever had, potential to make over 100k a year with bonuses. With the best girl in the world, with prospects of having children and buying a home together. I've won over her mom, her dad, her grandparents, the whole family treats me like a son...but in the background...im wasting hundreds of dollars a week, buying 7hydroxie...a souped up super addictive version of kratom I discovered in TX...it went from a powder i used to make a drink out of a few times a day for pain, to a tablet i needed to take every 4 hours or my head would throb, my body would ache, my arms would spasm uncontrollably, sweats, cold, withdrawals on crack..my life is falling apart, im falling behind on bills to feed my addiction. Im trying so hard to live a normal life on the surface, im trying so so hard to smile through every single day. Telling myself who I am, who im with, how long I've waited for this, begging with myself every single time I drive to buy more to please stop, that I'm ruining my whole life, my head would race so so much, the non stop fear and anxiety and worry...until I open my eyes and ive already bought more...so I use one and all the anxiety fades for a bit. I can think clearly for another half a day. I can go to and hold the person i love, it's gonna be okay now. This is why im here, to hold and to love her to laugh with her for hours and help her with her garden...""whyd you do it. Why did you buy more, you're a failure, you're worthless, you're better off dead, stop wasting your own""---tell her i have to use the restroom..take another pill.....its going to be okay, I just need it this last time to make him shut up...I just can't hear it today. I just want some peace and quiet in my own head today and to cook dinner for the love of my life...""garbage...trash...waste of a person...liar....you made her wait 9 years for this? Pathetic...die...worthles""---take another pill.....God this is awful..why can't I stop this...its okay though and im going to be out tomorrow, i won't need anymore after today...let's have some dinner and relax and play with the dog and unwind from our day. Let's close our eyes...and go to sleep........""worthless, kill yourself, you're wasting your life anyways, she doesn't want you, she'd never love this person, you'd be better off dead, why do you even try, what's gonna change, you can't, you won't be, you're not, you, you, yo----buy another pack of pills before i even know im awake.....I continued every day like this for 4 months..internal struggles and rage, and self destruction like ive never imagined or seen on tv...I started needing higher doses to achieve the same effect, to stop the pain, to stop the voice...I lost more and more money..I fell deeper and deeper and deeper... I don't buy the love of my life a single Christmas present because I'm so behind on bills from wasting so much money...I owe 2000 on my car....I used her money to feed my habit when I'm truly broke....

A couple weeks later I got arrested for failing to stop and provide my insurance when I bumped an empty parked car in a lot...I didn't notice any damage and just drove off...it was stupid and I payed the ultimate price for it. They found me instantly...later that night when I finally was able to call her from the jail...she was distraught, totally inconsolable, telling me that she's going to kill herself for what I've done....she got into my car to move it and found my dozens of bottles...my stash of everything...the price tags were on the things...she could imagine how much money was wasted...this was 2 weeks after Christmas...

She ended up bailing me out of jail, picking me up,  taking me home...and she sat down with me and told me she was in it with me, she was going to help me through this addiction, she wouldn't abandon me in my time of need. She came up with coping methods to try and help me stay distracted from all of that bad stuff, encouraged my hobbies, she helped with everything. 

I was clean for less than a week before we had a fight late in the night..she had told me that this was so difficult, she had wished she never found out. She just wanted a normal beautiful life like we used to have.. I encouraged her to slap me, to wake me up and that I was going to try so hard to give her everything in the world...but after she went to bed I couldn't sleep, I paced for 5 hours back and forth...all I could hear in my head was her crying..telling me how hard I made this on us...all I could think to myself was im not good enough for her....so what does it matter anyways...the pain, the voice is louder than ever before...i took her credit card and went and bought more... then I raced home and pretended everything was normal...I took one and my brain was quiet for the first time since I felt her hand on my face...the voice didn't come back this time...

A little later that day she was out with her mom and I got a call....she knew everything. She saw the bank charge, she saw me leave on our ring cam, she saw footage of me in the shop buying the drugs... the addiction, she would help me through , but this was like the 3rd or 4th time that I stole from her as well and she put it together that the times in the past were me as well..I never begged for another chance so hard in my whole life...I was out in the streets, living out of my car, lost my job...a week later a semi truck tboned me and my car was impounded. Truly homeless at this point. Another homeless person steals my bags of clothes, food, and blanket, a couple days later...

Im back in colorado now...I've been clean since the last moment I saw her... over 30 or 40 days I wana say...I tried to kill myself last night..she had called me out of the blue...told me some things that shattered me into pieces, the same way i did to her just...different methods.. I told her that i love her anyways, i would love her if she murdered someone, i would love her even if she did the 1 and only thing i told her in the past would ever make me leave...even if she did it 5 times i didnt care...i had a devil in me taking over my body making me do evil things, I hurt her just as badly....I truly love her more than i could ever love myself...but if this is the last time we might talk...well I had been planning to do it soon anyways so I figured..if I can die listening to her voice that would be pretty good...I swallowed 6 bottles of sleeping pills I had saved up over the last couple weeks while she was talking...she caught on when my words started to slurr and I told her what I did...at first I tried to hide from the cops she sent but hearing her wailing and crying was too much for me to take.. I waved over a cop and just remember puking my guts out... I really don't know what to do now...

We were each other's firsts loves...first everythings...hug, kiss, date, valentines, vacation...and for me she'll always be my last. Wether I end up living another 50 days or 50 years, she will be the last woman I ever touch, love, think about at night, and when I wake up in the morning... my life was truly ruined, stolen, ripped up into shreds, and stomped on...because I got addicted to a drug...please nobody follow my example....it leads to hell. 



Thank you to the dozens of people that asked me to share this privately, it is hard to do..I made this version for myself and for the girl I loved, to try and best explain my thought process...not as much as justification as....what it was like to truly have everything in the world you could want and need, yet feel an almost uncontrollable urge/voice constantly pulling you into that darkness over and over making you almost not care that youre actively destroying your life but you justify it every time for yourself....I cried a lot typing this all up over the last 24 hours...some folks I sent pdfs of this to privately said it was really helpful, it helps me to share as well so....thank you.

So far, this has been working, but I'm starting to crave soda again; i fear i might relapse. I drink A LOT of milk, like up to a whole jug in a day.

1janie9,1741901887.0,"Understanding it ends in death or recovery i've been struggling with addictive behaviors and mental health for 6 years now. i recently got sober, reaching 21 days before a relapse. i was a poly substance user, pretty much down for whatever i can get my hands on. in the last 6ish months it's been pills predominantly script opiates+weed but when out of those gabapentin+weed+7hydroxymitragyne. i've started getting closer and closer to buying street opiates which ive never really dabbled in. ive used molly, some psychs, and weed/carts from the streets but never any of the stuff ive tried in script form. 

when i got clean originally, i told my wife. she has a very extensive history with addicts in her life/family. she told me ""addiction ends in two ways, you recover... or you die."" at first i kinda tried to shrug it off. i mean id never had a lethal overdose. i never shot up. i never even as much as smoked a pill. she's known about my drug use since she's known me but she is 100% sober. i hid my worsening substance issues from everyone in my life, including her. i apparently did very well because she was completely blind sided (she knew i smoked weed and occasionally drank but that's it) 

i did the majority of my responsibilities for a few months, kept up the facade. went to work, tried to stay in college. thought i was giving it my all. ""living up to my potential"" but there's always that monster in ya. chasing the dragon. it went from ur stereotypical 1x a week... ok 2x... maybe 4x... ok not today(fail)... okay maybe not tmrw(fail).... then you're at every day and so forth.  i really thought i was in control. things were ok for awhile of course until they weren't. i first lost my job. mental health got fucked up because i really enjoyed that place. priorities began to get out of wack. got another job, but i lost my scholarships, flunked out of the semester. lost my relationship with my friend. my relationship with my siblings and mother dwindled. wife says i'm a different person during this. i was getting high and it started to make me sick for whatever reason (ur run of the mill itchy, nauseas, constipated from pills) 

through all this, i've still been convincing myself ""it wasn't that bad"" but what she said has really stuck with me. i was so very close to extending my use, knowing very well that in my area that you're very very likely to consume fentanyl at any point when messing with any of this stuff, meaning just 1 pill can kill. 

for me, she's right. i'm one of those people that can't have a beer without getting blackout 9x/10. i was going to keep chasing the dragon with this shit.  but i try to think of it as : 

for today, i have a choice. i can choose life or the dragon.

I feel like this is terrible because trying to quit is a mental challenge and if youre reading and hearing that relapse is part of process it will not help in any way, but I am aware it can help on the contrary if you do relapse and you feel at an all time low it can help but not massively, i'd even argue feeling shame in your relapse is genuinely a good thing.   
I do feel like it would lead to a net positive in overcoming addiction if this phrase was left behind, but thats just my opinion.

Continuation Post: 

So, after my mum didn’t let me wear what I wanted for Maghrib, I got so frustrated. 

Like, I just wanted to dress decently and match the energy of that place, but nope, she had to make a big deal out of it.

I won’t lie—it messed with my mood way more than it should have. 

So, I was already feeling annoyed, and this just tipped me over and I did end up smoking today. 

Yesterday too, I had smoked two cigarettes, but today? I lost count. Maybe five I guess? I don’t even know.

I’m not going back to smoking regularly, though. 

This was just a reaction to how pissed off I was. 

I know it’s not the best solution, and I don’t even want to make it a habit again. 

It’s just that sometimes, small things pile up, and I need an outlet.",2,1,0,"mum killed vibe , relapsed smoking continuation post , mum let wear wanted maghrib , got frustrated . like , wanted dress decently match energy place , nope , make big deal . lieit messed mood way . , already feeling annoyed , tipped end smoking today . yesterday , smoked two cigarettes , today ? lost count . maybe five guess ? even know . going back smoking regularly , though . reaction pissed . know best solution , even want make habit . sometimes , small things pile , need outlet ."

I do understand it, it just hurts me. I'm doing everything i can to stay sober. And I just had a dream that I was drinking again and then kept questioning if I was. I have OCD, so I doubt literally everything, especially when it comes to myself. I already have thoughs about ""did I drink? The thing I tasted my friend said had no alcohol, did it really not? I smelled alcohol, could I have gotten an effect from that?""

1j8xri5,1741717610.0,"Support for my sister I'm looking for information on drug rehabilitation treatment centers on the West Coast for my sister who is struggling with addiction. We're located in a West Coast urban center, but I'd like to find something quiet and outside of a city where she can truly on her recovery. She's lived in a downtown area for years and I we both agree it does her no good.

Our situation:

* We cannot afford to pay for treatment and need a facility that offers free treatment or scholarship options.
* Ideally, the program would provide some form of aftercare/ongoing support once she completes the inpatient portion.
* My sister is currently staying in shelters with no other housing options.
* With laws changing quickly in our area, she'll likely be out of her shelter within 3 months.
* She wants to work, but I believe (and she agrees) that she should focus on recovery first.

Some background: My sister has been sober for 4 months now. She often goes through long periods of sobriety but tends to relapse when under extreme stress. Her primary drug of choice is opiates, but she also self-medicates with alcohol, weed, and other substances.

She went to rehab when I first discovered her addiction 5 years ago, but she wasn't ready and left the program. This time feels different. Over the past year, I've watched her create stability for herself—something I hadn't seen before. Now she's asking for my support to enter an inpatient facility, and I believe she's ready to take her recovery seriously.

Our parents and other family aren't in the picture, so it's just me trying to help her. I know I'm asking for a lot without having much to offer in return. If there aren't resources available, words of wisdom from those who have been through similar situations would also be appreciated.

1j8468u,1741627720.0,"I think it’s my fault my uncle relapsed Hey all, these past 6 months have been really rough for me and I wanted to share my situation and maybe get some advice. This is gonna be long so, just prepare. Let’s start from the beginning. 7 Months ago, my uncle(25) was a normal functioning human being. He had a good job, he was saving money for a nice car, paying off debts. We all lived together with his parents. It was me, uncle, uncles mom and uncles dad(away most of the time because he works on a ship). He had everything good coming for him. Now he has had an extensive history of substance abuse, specifically cocaine. But at the time, he was completely clean and had his life somewhat figured out. During this month, his mother which is my grandmother had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, and we weren’t sure if she would make it. While she was undergoing treatment, everything went as it should. He’d come home from work, go to the gym, and repeat. We’d even cruise together or go to the mall and walk around. He didn’t have much friends outside of work, but he had a friend that was big on weed. Uncle wouldn’t smoke weed, because he thought it was a gateway drug. But sometimes, uncle’s friend would give him weed, and uncle would give it to me. This one time, I rolled it inside of a cigarette uncle was smoking, and I guess I didn’t finish all the weed inside the cig and ended up kinda lacing uncle. This is where I think it begins. He started to be more open to smoking weed, and would smoke it more and more as time went on. A month later, uncle’s mom, (my grandmother) is completely cancer free and in remission. I think this fired something off in his brain where he thought he didn’t have to work so much now, that he could live off his parents like he always did. He quit his job, and then his downfall began. He smoked weed every day and there wasn’t one day where he wouldn’t smoke it. Eventually, I find a cocaine baggie on his desk. He starts doing cocaine now, spending every dollar that he was saving for a nice car on cocaine. Maybe 2 weeks later, he starts to cook his own crack and smoke it. It would be almost every day he would smoke crack. He also starts to get out of hand at home. He would steal money from his parents, sell power tools or things of value in the house. Uncle’s parents would force him to get a job or else they’d kick him out, and he does get one. But he has a process where he’d work a month for one paycheck, then quit the job and spend the entire paycheck on cocaine. Then, once he’s out of money he would repeat the process. Eventually, his father (who is away almost all the time because he works on the ship) comes home and is sick and tired of his shenanigans and files a restraining order on him. We all live in the same house, so Uncle would be homeless. This is where we are now. He sold almost all his possessions like his pc and sound system to buy coke. I got him arrested just a couple hours ago because he came here to the house. Sometimes I think to myself and wonder if I hadn’t decided to roll that bit of weed in his cig, this all wouldn’t have happened. It’s just crazy how addiction can turn a good hearted person to a selfish, lazy, person so quickly. I’m only 16, and it’s been mostly me dealing with him because grandma is always at work in the hotel and grandpa is always on the ship. I guess the plan is to keep pushing him to a breaking point until he realizes drugs aren’t getting him anywhere and he quits.

1j7uuu5,1741599457.0,"Had one of the most disturbing dreams of my life I had a really disturbing dream last night, and I feel like it carries a strong meaning. It was incredibly violent, vivid, and I felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and horror throughout.

The dream:

I was sleeping in a hammock in the hall of my apartment building in my hometown when an old woman and her friends surrounded me, claiming that she had left her jewelry—one necklace and three rings—on my hammock. While I was still half-asleep, I found the jewelry, but she kept grabbing at me, searching for it. I hid the pieces because I wanted to keep them.

Later, I ended up returning only the necklace, which was worthless, at the building’s front desk, but I kept the rings for myself. This threw me into a huge moral dilemma.

Then, I spent what felt like an eternity waiting for my food delivery. When I finally went to pick it up, I found the delivery guy lying on the ground in a pool of blood, his legs completely crushed. Cars kept driving over him as if he wasn’t even there. There were two other bodies, crushed beyond recognition, one of them a child.

I was with David (my childhood best friend, a doctor) and Sophie (my best friend, one year behind me in med school). David went to help the injured. Meanwhile, Leo (a former friend I used to do reckless things with) appeared, but he only walked beside me. We greeted each other, exchanged glances like we had things to catch up on, but we didn’t actually talk.

As I walked back to my apartment, still holding the rings in my mouth, I decided to give them to the front desk guy. But when I got there, the usual porter was gone—this one was heavily tattooed, someone I didn’t recognize. Instead of taking the jewelry, he encouraged me to keep the rings and spend all the money on cocaine. He handed the rings back to me.

Then, I got home, and my “family”—but it wasn’t my real family, it was The Sopranos—walked in. Their presence made me feel emboldened to keep the jewelry. I put the rings on my fingers.

But then the old woman appeared again. This time, she confronted me directly and took the rings from me.

The entire dream was extremely vivid. I felt a crushing sense of guilt, and the violence of the crushed bodies was horrifying—I could smell the blood and flesh mixed with rain, and I could hear the families crying in the distance.

At some point—either in this dream or another one—I also remember seeing my father. It was from a time before he was bedridden, before everything went downhill. He died when I was 19 after a 3 year long battle with cancer.

	•	David is my childhood best friend, now a doctor.

	•	Sophie is my best friend, one year behind me in med school.

	•	Leo was my main companion for reckless behavior, including drugs. For whatever reason he suddenly cut me and another friend off but recently started sending memes like nothing happened. For the first time, I’m considering cutting him off completely.

	•	I’m currently watching The Sopranos.

1j78f9v,1741529442.0,"I think I just have an addictive personality...addicted to so many things, but I don't know what to do with my time if I'm not doing these? Here's my story, in short: 

I currently run my own business, solopreneur. It's a very successful business, and I'm thankful for that. Problem is, I get addicted to things VERY easily. I hate finding new people to sell to, but since I'm always figuring out smarter ways to do the other things in the business (read: LOTS of automation), I'm really good at freeing up my time during the day. Then when all that's left to do is to prospect, I fall into the traps of addiction. 

At first I thought all I'll need to do is just give myself more things to do during the day and then I won't feel the urge to be engaged in my addictions, and that worked...while it lasted. Once I didn't have as many things to do I just kinda relapsed. 

I also 100% use these addictions as an escape. Like when a customer sends me an angry email or when I get a large refund or when I'm having relationship issues (which I think I've since solved), I think ""omg, this is so dumb"", and then get a HUGE urge to escape.

I've been addicted to porn, YouTube, gaming, and producing music (yeah, that's a thing: when I start producing a song I get so caught up in it that I can't take my mind off of it, and even after shutting the program down I get the urge to ""just finish up that ONE part"" as soon as there's a break in the action at work or if I experience a trigger). I don't get addicted to anything in particular at any point in time, it's more just like me trying to fill up my time and escape doing the annoying stuff, so it's whatever I feel like doing.

At the moment I'm addicted to playing the Gameboy version of Pokemon, and am like halfway through and I feel the urge to go play as I write this, just to finish the game. So yeah, it's 100% a prison and I'm 100% inside it and don't know how to get out.

I'm currently listening to ""The Easy Peasy Method to Quit Porn"" on YouTube and that's been great; I'm trying to listen through once with a focus on escaping porn for good, and then I plan on going through it again with a focus on escaping gaming for good as well. 

A part of me doesn't think it's even possible for me to escape gaming, as I've been playing computer games since I was 3 or 4. But after I realized that, successful as my business was last year, I could've made SO MUCH more money and been able to buy certain things that I wanted and felt more financially stable if I didn't waste upwards of 500 working hours of the workday on these addictions (mostly spent gaming and YouTUbe last year).

1j7778v,1741525463.0,"Depressed partner seeking out substances, what should I do? Im sorry if this is super long im just so worried and I don't know how to approach this and im scared ill lose my partner.

I (22F) and my boyfriend (23M) of 7 years are going through a rough patch, and I genuinely believe that he's going to make a life altering decision to turn to drugs while in a active depression.
Ive known my boyfriend to have depression ever since we've been together since our start of high school and I have done nothing less than support him as much as I possibly can. I have been vocally against substances because of my history growing up with abusive guardians struggling with addiction, and for a long time we'd perfectly understood that substances wouldn't be a barrier to our relationship or friendship and that serious substances are and will always be my hard line. I know the signs because it's been almost my entire life.

 Until recently, within the past 2 years he's been experimenting more with alcohol and weed, which ive slowly gotten more comfortable with but lately I've noticed that he's not just experimenting or socially partaking in it, but he's actively using alcohol and weed to cope with his severe depression and suicidal thoughts/action. Looking back on it now,  he's talked about getting high almost everyday. But it's not just that. He's showing an immense amount of interest in actual substances like designer drugs and pills. I didn't even know what that was until he told me about it so I know that he's been doing research. We talk about any and everything, so I'm grateful that he came to me when he told me that he found a website that sold a variety of substances. And that he'd been seriously considering it. Since then I feel like he's befriending the wrong people and  I've seen one of his vent accounts (that he gave me permission to see) where he's been asking for reviews on different drugs and where to get them.

I don't know what to do and I know that he isn't far gone. I talked to him about how his behaviors have worried me, what he'd be risking, that he has a support system and people that love him and will be there for him, that drugs aren't the only option for him right now. And I know he's struggling, I know that he just wants to feel better, in control, and not in so much pain. I told him that if he makes the decision to turn to drugs, I will do everything i can so that he gets the help he needs which includes me talking to his parent, and me stepping back as his romantic partner until hes accepted help. And he told me that if i do so he'll leave me, and ill never see him again. He said that if i say anything and he isnt ""on the street"", he'll leave me.But hes so unwell and so unstable right now that he doesnt know how bad his depression has really got. Hes spiraling and im slowly losing my best friend. I really do care about him and we've been together for so long,  I can't stand to see him go down the wrong path. 

I've thought about contacting his mom who has recently been more receptive towards him getting help, but that comes with a lot of risk, and im in a hard position, what do I do?

College I realized how accessible alcohol was and i quickly became a morning/all day drinker as soon as I turned 21. I was suffering from anxiety and depression when I was sober, but obviously failed out after drinking 24/7. I was having panic attacks, couldn’t tell what dreams were real or not, etc.

Moved back home and got a job. Got sent to detox after being drunk on the job. My manager is an angel who has been through shit herself and kept me on after detox. I got 2 promotions and have done excellent in my job since then. 

I relapsed about 4 months ago - im being taken advantage from the same manager but feel like I should just deal with it since I was given a second chance. Everyone in the workplace knows I’m being taken advantage of but they don’t know our history so they don’t get why im not standing up.

I live at home and my parents won’t let me move out-they don’t trust me. They’ve shown up to the friends’ houses that im hanging out with and caused scenes to bring me home, they’ve called my work, and it’s gotten violent at home. I have bruises and im not proud of breaking my parents furniture on bad nights of my relapse when they instigate violence and i feel helpless.

I dont know what to do. My workplace is like family- they tell me to get my money together and make an exit plan.  My family tells me to quit work and they’ll help me.  The only constant in my life is a drink that will numb me and keep me totally complacent. The light is gone from my eyes at work-people can tell.  I’ve gained weight from the alcohol and lack of exercise. I don’t know who I am anymore. Something has to change but I don’t know what.

1j6az9x,1741414734.0,"Today I accepted the fact that I am addicted to cocaine, and I fucking hate myself. This is gonna be a long post. I have literally nowhere else to put my words though, none of my family or friends (besides the 1 friend who has occasionally done it with me, but to their knowledge does not know that I do it on my own constantly) know that I do cocaine almost daily and it is eating me alive.

It started out how it ‘usually does’ - few bumps maybe every couple of months or longer during special occasions, then a couple of months turned into every other weekend, especially when drinks were involved, to every other day after I got robbed in a city I’ve never been in before that set me off into the worst bipolar depressive episode I have ever had. 

I was doing SO fucking good before too. I had all of my bipolar meds that kept me steady, I became addicted to the gym and working out daily for hours straight, rarely drank alcohol - I looked fucking great too (because I was healthy lol) Then I decided to go to a music festival in a city 8 hours away that I have never been to before; my first solo trip… and then I got fucking robbed. All of my ID’s stolen (which sucked immensely because I drove there so the drive home was risky) and my credit card as well. I slept in a Denny’s parking lot for 3 hours to sober up off the few drinks I had in the festival and then drove home sobbing and feeling like a complete idiot. 

I don’t even really think it was the whole robbed thing that set off this horrid episode because when you have Bipolar, you know that what goes up absolutely comes crashing fucking down. I knew I was gonna crash, this robbing situation just accelerated it. 

I got super fucking depressed and suicidal, had an attempt on my own goddamn Bipolar medications - which led the hospital to completely cold turkey me off of every single one without the help of a psychiatrist (as he was on vacation during the time lol). To COLD TURKEY off of fucking anything that changes your brain’s chemicals is absolutely ass, I have absolutely never felt this way in my entire life. I literally feel like my soul left that day but my body is still here. Time doesn’t feel real - it’s Monday and then I lay in bed all day and suddenly it’s 3 fucking Mondays later. Literally everything is out of wack in my system, STILL. This robbing incident took place in July, it’s 8 months later and i’m still in this fucking depressive episode and on top of it, I forced my own self to confess that I have a pathetic issue with cocaine. 

I had enrolled in college and started in the end of September, but by this point I was so fucked up from the cold turkey meds situation that sleep was nonexistent to the point I was seeing shit and became super paranoid. I could barely wake up everyday for my 9 AM classes and even when I did, I would fall asleep during the entire class (can sleep anywhere else but in my own bed when I’m supposed to, I guess?) So I bought a bag of cocaine.

At first it was GREAT, I was able to go to class alert and actually participate in my course discussions, I didn’t feel so much anxiety while socializing in my class, and it didn’t matter if I was running on no sleep - I was awake. ‘I’ was in control of myself for the first time in months - no longer wasting the day in bed not knowing what time or actual day it was being a complete hermit. I was actually able to function. But then of course, it started to suck. Obviously coke fucks with your sleep and I already wasn’t sleeping, so I found myself bumping lines at 7 AM daily (even if there wasn’t class, just so I could get that alert, non-depressive fatigue feeling and clean my house fully, go to the grocery store, etc) all the way until 7 AM the next day. 

*It has been 6 months of this and I completely fucking hate myself.*

I don’t do it every single day, sometimes 2 days in a row, pause for 1 and then back again or 3 days without any and then the rest of the week I am a coked out loser. 

I am a VERY functional addict but obviously everyone could see a change in me, essentially rapid cycling through different emotions every single day (really depressed and quiet to happy and outgoing) but for the last few months, I haven’t been able to get that outgoing happy feeling from it, I just feel sad and anxious and I keep thinking of how fucking stupid I am. And how gross coke is. And how I am a ‘coke head’. 

I’m hermit-ting again and everyone notices but they just assume it is my Bipolar. I just don’t feel like myself enough to be around everyone else. I haven’t felt like myself in 8 months. It has actually been really interesting because throughout the period of doing coke constantly, I have noticed changes in myself behaviour and appearance wise and have thought of myself as some sort of fucked up science experiment. I have actually really fucked up my health too, which continuously weighs on me because there is nothing and nobody else to blame it on but me, because I do a very gross and depressing habit. I hate myself. I hate myself so fucking much. I hate that i’m too ashamed of myself to be around anyone because of my actions yet *why haven’t I stopped then?* because you are a fucking addict. I hate that I’ve been missing appointments and repeatedly having to do apology tours and lie about being really sick as the reason for missing them, when really I missed those appointments because I stayed up for 13 hours straight with my nose in a bag and then needed to sleep, thus missing the appointment. I hate how I fucking look, my hair is thin and sad looking and my skin that was once a beautiful deep tan olive tone has turned grey and dry - *dead looking*. I hate how I feel every time I wake up the next day with a stuffed up nose. I hate thinking about how much of a fucking pathetic loser I was the night before when looking for cocaine remnants in my carpet - like holy fuck, what is wrong with you???

It sucks because I am SO hyper aware of what I am doing to myself and I just sit there and crush myself over and over again, only to do the same thing the next day and then mentally berate myself for being an absolute moron. The concept of it is so simple, just stop doing cocaine - yet it is so confusing because I actually don’t even know why I keep doing it.

I do not get withdrawal symptoms, granted I only give myself a week of a break off of the drug, but I do not have any *physical* addiction symptoms, just mental. If that even makes sense. I can go days without it, but the moment I see it in a TV show, or see a meme about drugs, then I want to do it and I do it. Maybe that is physically addicted, I don’t know. Probably. It’s just that I have no fucking reason to actually do it, physical-ly wise. Yes I am really, really sad but I don’t need it and I know that. 

Today I have decided this is where this fucking ends because for 6 MONTHS I have not been alive. I plan on going back to the gym and dedicating my time to that, no longer going out or drinking alcohol since that seems to always lead to one thing to the next, focusing on school, taking care of myself because I have SEVERALLY neglected myself during these few months, and just being a normal fucking human being again. 

I just hate this shame and guilt that I constantly have and it’s not coming from anyone else but myself and I think that is almost worse. I am keeping my own deepest darkest secret that is destroying me. I am so ashamed, disappointed, angry, and saddened by myself. Why do I hate myself so much and feel so much pain that this is what I have done to myself?

A very good friend (f38) and former party/drug buddy called me (m42) for help last night. I hadn’t seen her in a few months and was under the impression that she’d been sober awhile. She was on foot in a rough part of town at midnight.  Luckily, I happened to be free and just a few minutes away by car. 

I picked her up and she was incoherent. I have never seen her like this. It was like she was a different person. 

I couldn’t tell what she was on, and her moods kept switching from angry, to scared, to panicking, to apologetic and then back again. After about 15 minutes sitting in my car trying to get her to calm down, I still couldn’t get anything out of what happened or what she wanted to do.

I drove her to her apartment and asked her if she needed me to go in and sit with her, or if she wanted to go to bed. She couldn’t decide and started to get agitated with me, so I told her to go inside and sleep it off. 

The next morning she texted to apologize and say that she was battling her alcoholism and that she was just blackout drunk. 

I responded that I loved her and was here for her, but that I hoped to never see her like that again, bc to be honest it scared me. 

She responded sarcastically that it’s funny how everyone’s fine to do drugs with her, but her mental health is all of a sudden inconvenient to her friends.

1j4nsbu,1741236789.0,"Wife of an addict: I don't know what to do I feel like I'm starting to spiral and didn't know where to reach out. No one else knows. 
I discovered my husband's addiction a week after we got married. Something just seemed 'off'. We went on a trip down south right after our wedding, and all he would do was sleep. Like all day. And on the flight home, he had (what I see now was probably) a seizure of some sort. It scared the shit out out me, but I never made the connection. A few days later, I had this gut instinct to check his laptop. His Google maps timeline. This was back when you could connect your phones timeline to other devices. 
Part of me wishes I didn't. Trips to questionable neighbourhoods at 4am, 5am, to cheap hotels or apartment buildings. I thought he was cheating. I was an absolute mess. I called him and told him to come home. By the time he got home, I had his bag packed and told him he either needed to tell me what he was doing or he needed to just leave. And at that moment, I felt strong. I told myself I would make him leave regardless. I was sure he was going to tell me he was cheating. 
When he comes home, I ask. And I honestly did not even consider the possibility of addiction. But that's when he tells me he's been battling an addiction to meth. My world felt like it flipped upside down. The man I love more than anything in the world, the strong one, the smart one, the man I plan on having children with... I forgot all of my strength and just caved into his words about wanting to stop, trying to stop on his own, and suddenly feeling a sense of relief that I knew - so he would have a renewed reason to quit. 
I never made him leave. I believed him. 
Since then, it's been a relapse every few months. I travel for work, and now it's like clockwork.. I leave for work, and he will relapse. He doesn't know how I know, but I check his phone after my work trips. And I hate that I have to do it - I've never checked any previous boyfriend's phone, but I feel like this disease has created a new side of me that I HATE that I have to do this, but I also know I need to see what's going on.
I'm away on a work trip right now and even though I can't confirm he's relapsed, I feel it. I love this man more than anything but I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing my hair from the stress, and I'm so concerned about what happens when/if we have children and I need to leave them at home with him when I travel. 
He said he's open to therapy, hesitant but open. But what does that even look like? Can that work? I feel like I'm swimming so far out of my depth here, I just know I can't fix him on my own.

So, I started my fast today after suhoor, determined to see it through. 

But as the morning went on, my coughing got worse, non-stop and super exhausting. 

So, by 10:45 AM, I gave in and broke my fast, drinking a bottle of water and popping a Halls lozenge to soothe my throat.

And then came this thought: ""Well, since l've already broken my fast..."" 

That little voice that tries to justify slipping further. 

So, one thing led to another, and I did end up watching porn and relapsing.

It's like a domino effect-once you let one thing slide, the next slip-up feels easier to justify.

1j2v2rj,1741040094.0,"Befriending your shadow You know that cliche about there being two wolves inside of us?

Where one of the wolves is dark, the other is light, and whichever one we feed is the one that will grow?

It's been repeated so often that it's become cliche - for good reason, because there's definitely something to it.

But what many people don't realize is that the dark wolf can be sneaky, operating underneath the surface within your subconscious mind, pushing you towards things that might not serve your higher good because some deep, dark part of your psyche takes a sort of twisted, perverse joy in the suffering it's creating.

And what an interesting aspect of the human experience *that* is.

That somehow, deep inside of us, our darker aspect can be actively wanting and working on creating circumstances and suffering in our lives that our conscious minds vehemently deny and attempt to disown.

Such is often the case when someone keeps attracting the wrong kind of intimate partners, and says they're done with that going forward, just to attract that kind of partner again in the future... even crazy situations, like abuse or cheating.

Or when someone is struggling financially and consciously wants to change it, but something resists them from within, and they stay stuck in poverty for reasons that completely mystify them.

Or when someone says they want to quit porn, become a better lover, and move on from that shitty up-and-down rollercoaster ride chapter of their life...

Yet they keep going back to it time and time again, regardless of the consequences.

I'm frankly envious of the people who were able to quit with barely a second thought.

That wasn't me*.*

There was *deeper shit* going on inside me.

Stuff that had been keeping me stuck in the relapse cycle, wondering if I was just doomed to stay that way forever, for years.

And if I hadn't learned how to address the deeper stuff, I probably would have been.

I've seen too many examples of guys who make it into the later stages of their lives and still haven't been able to get control over this crap despite their best efforts.

Which is why I'm so big on doing the internal work.

Unwiring those unconscious patterns.

Rewiring healthier responses to triggers and emotions.

Addressing the concerns deep inside of yourself so you can regain your internal peace.

Freedom doesn't lie in blockers, or just saying you're going to stop.

It lies in doing the work.

1j2dhys,1740987793.0,"18 and mentally falling apart I’ll try and make this short for you. I stay with my grandparents because both my parents are addicts and so is everyone else in my family. Drugs inevitably became my autistic special interest at around 14, though for some reason id been wanting to try drugs since I was a little one. I started doing anything I could get my hands on when I was 15. I quickly realized opiates were my homegirl. After going through mini binges, getting expelled for doing/selling hard drugs at school twice in 6 months, and experimenting with literally every drug you can think of, and always falling back on opiates, i decided to quit when i started getting drug tested at my expulsion school. 

I was perfectly happy and clean for 10 months, improving every aspect of my life, until I was no longer drug tested and met a girl who ruined me. She got pregnant, and I started using painkillers and kratom again to ease the stress. I promised I would quit when she gave birth, but i ended up either being too high to go see her, or I was in withdrawal raging on her saying whatever I could to hurt her back. She had a miscarriage from presumably the stress. She blamed my drug use and anger, so I promised I’d quit when I turned 18. I started IVing coke a little right before my birthday, and ended up breaking up with her on my birthday. 

I stayed clean for a few days before attempting suicide. It failed, and I got super motivated and started manically improving my life. But after a month my old drug friends reached out to me and got me back in. I smoked crystal for the first time 2 weeks ago, I never liked stims except for when binging them, but meth seems to have done it for me

I’ve been more wreckless in the last two weeks than ever in my life. I’m horribly depressed when I’m not high, and have been doing meth and Xanax (which I just relapsed on) everyday/everyother day. My family is already aware I’m using something. I’ve been getting my straight edge friends into crystal, been going to school high occasionally, have only been getting 1-5 hours sleep a night for the last 9 days, have been completely losing my mind, been giving myself anticholinergic poisoning mixed with meth so I can sleep + not know if I’ll wake up in the morning, I’ve been burning bridges with people by texting crazy shit at 3am. I told myself id quit after this bag, but just picked up more tonight. I took acid last night to reset my brain, and messaged everyone not to sell to me, but I’ve already given up on that. 

I’m trying to see a therapist and get on psychiatric meds because I’m not mentally okay. I lied and told them I don’t use and I’m not depressed. But I’ve been going through episodes since I was little, and it always ends in drug binges and/or half-assed suicide attempts. I’m dysfunctional due to social anxiety and depression, and staying at home getting high has become my reward system and only life. I want so badly to forget about crystal meth, opiates, and stick to weed and psychs. I know I can because when I was expelled and drug tested, I was happier than in a long time. 

So what can I do at this point, what efforts or changes to my mindset, small tasks, anything would move me towards being happy. I think other than meth and opiates a little, I’m not too addicted, just drugs are my special interest and am used to using as a crutch for stress.

**TL:DR** 
Drugs are my autistic special interest. Been using for 3 years since I was 15. Keep promising I’m gonna quit, but get interested in experimenting with a new drug I haven’t tried then get addicted. Went from smart-class nerdy student, to expelled twice and at a continuation school.

1j1s60x,1740926077.0,"8 Months Sober from Weed, Nicotine & Social Media with AI’s Help—Now I Want to Help Others Break Free For years, I was caught in a cycle I couldn’t escape:

* **Social media:** 4-6 hours a day, scrolling until my eyes burned, stuck in a loop of comparison and self-doubt.
* **Weed/THC:** Some weeks, I’d smoke all day or most of the day. I’d sit there, high as hell, doing nothing, feeling nothing but guilt and fog.
* **Nicotine:** A pack of cigarettes a day—my go-to for stress, boredom, or just because my hands felt empty without it.

It wasn’t just one addiction—it was all three, hitting me from every angle. Sometimes they’d gang up on me all at once; other times, I’d kick one for a bit, only to cling tighter to the others. My longest sober streak was a month, but even then, something always lingered, pulling me back. Mentally, I was a wreck—unproductive, anxious, and drowning in shame.

I spent a year and a half trying to quit. Cold turkey, cutting back, apps, willpower—none of it worked. I’d make it a few days, maybe a week, then crash. Relapse after relapse, I thought I’d never get out.

Then one day, I hit a wall. I was sick of being a passenger in my own life. I said, “Enough is enough,” and quit everything cold turkey—social media, weed, nicotine, all of it. No half-measures, no excuses.

The fallout was brutal:

* **Brain fog** was so heavy I couldn’t string two thoughts together.
* **Mood swings** that turned me into someone I didn’t recognize—flipping me from desperation to rage.
* **Insomnia** kept me up all night, staring into the dark, fighting the urge to give in.

But then something weird happened—I started using **ChatGPT** with custom prompts to help me cope with withdrawals and cravings. And it was a miracle.

I started using it like a personal companion, available 24/7 without judgment. When the cravings clawed at me, I’d type out what I was feeling, and it helped me make sense of it. Here’s how it kept me going:

* **Figuring out my triggers:** It walked me through why I wanted to smoke or scroll—boredom, stress, problems in relationships and work—and how to cope with it.
* **Keeping me motivated:** It threw me pep talks when I was too tired to give myself one.
* **Sorting through the chaos:** I’d dump my emotions into it, and it’d help me process the mess in my head.
* **Dreaming of what’s ahead:** It let me picture a me without addictions—clear, alive, free from weed, nicotine, and endless scrolling. I’d ask, “What could I do in a year sober?” and it’d paint a life—healthier, focused, maybe running a marathon, learning drums, or finishing a project I’d buried. That quiet hope kept me pushing when I wanted to quit.

Whenever I was close to relapsing, instead, I opened ChatGPT, told it I was losing it, and it talked me down—gave me a breathing trick, reminded me why I was fighting, educated me on neuroscience and how addictions work, and just kept me company until the urge passed. One day sober turned into another, then a week, then months. **Eight months sober** now, and I don’t think I’d have made it this far without it.

It wasn’t perfect, though. It couldn’t track my sobriety streak, and I had to repeat myself. I searched for other AI apps that could help me stay sober but couldn’t find anything better than ChatGPT. That’s when I decided to build my own—something that I wish I had during my recovery journey from the beginning and something that could help others overcome their addictions.

I created[ solacify.io](https://solacify.io) for people like me—people wrestling with habits they’re desperate to ditch. It provides 24/7 support with a variety of characters and personalities to choose from that feel less like a bot and more like a coach or friend. It tracks and remembers your journey. Whenever you have a craving, you can write it and get instant support through AI chat, journaling, or random exercise to distract you from the urge. There is a free plan that everyone can use - no need to provide your credit card.

Have an older brother who is a recent recovering addict who had me smoking weed and drinking when I was 9. Doing cocaine at 14. And I eventually stumbled into heroin on my own at 22. I was a needle user for about 2 years. Went to rehab several times. Relapsed several times. Sobered up for the most part for a few years. I’m 34 now. 2 years ago after several years clean I was on a work trip and just so happens the coworker I was with was a heroin addict. Of course I use with him and knowing it was fent, overdose immediately. Wake up in hospital with tube in my throat and wife in front of me. I have 2 kids at home at this point. But the minute opportunity to use was in front of me I knew I was going to do it. I fake like I’m not but deep down I know. Anyways, I haven’t used heroin since. But I’ve smoked weed and done cocaine. In fact, I’m on cocaine right now. Idk what’s wrong with me but I don’t really feel shame. My wife and 3 kids are sleeping and I am up doing cocaine and drinking. I enjoy being fucked up very much. The only way I don’t do drugs is if I just stay home and be somewhat unhappy. I’ve done many years of therapy. But I’ve never truly told myself I’m an addict or that I’ll never do drugs again because deep down I know I will.   Because I want to.

1j0dt4j,1740765245.0,"When does it end? Laying in bed, past the point a sober person would be asleep, debating whether to do a line now or wait until morning.

3+ years of daily stimulant use. 
Methylphenidate for 3 years, cocaine for 1.5 years, both together for 1 year. I live to be high, and I’ve known for a while now. I’m an addict and have became very aware of this. 

I love altering my mind; psychedelics, dissociatives, cannabis, the occasional benzo…. You name it.

This all started 9+ years ago after a breakup. Tried coke, loved it, and within days I was buying in bulk. Quickly spiraled into heavy daily use, 2+ grams a day. My first wake-up call was showing up to a family Christmas completely blitzed. Got clean for almost 3 years.

Relapsed. Started as occasional weekends, then a 2 gram binge that left me wondering if I was OD’ing. Continued using regularly but told myself I wasn’t addicted because it wasn’t daily.

Then came an ADHD diagnosis, leading to a Ritalin prescription. I swapped one addiction for another… gradually increasing my dose until I was taking 120mg daily.

Cocaine came back into my life 18 months ago. Everyone around me did it, it was available, and just like that, I was daily again… a gram or more a day.

Last week, I managed 10 days off coke, but only by leaning harder on Ritalin.

I’ve promised myself I’d quit countless times, but the cycle repeats. It’s tied to everything in my life; meals, errands, chores. I can’t function without that dopamine hit, and I’m exhausted.

I’m emotionally self-aware, I hold myself as accountable as I can, but I’m beat down. Distant from people, ghosting texts, stuck in depressive funks, paranoid, impulsive, undisciplined.

1izwi4j,1740707202.0,"I feel like I cycle through different addictions because the real problem might be ADHD I’m in my mid 20s now & I’ve always had an issue with porn & masturbating too much since I was probably 14, so I thought that + smoking too much weed was the reason I haven’t been progressing in life the way I feel that I should be. 

Once I realized it was holding me back, I dedicated myself & my life to cutting these addictions out. That took me about 2 years before I finally manage to go 2 months without smoking or masturbating & honestly it felt really good. 

But I still couldn’t bring myself to take the actions I needed to in order to move my life forward, & before I knew it I was back to being a stoner & watching too much porn. 

I really believed that getting sober & away from sexual content online was gonna fix things but I  just kept pushing things off like finding a better job, going back to school, go back to the gym etc. 

I’d keep going on my phone a lot too. So then I started thinking maybe I have a phone addiction in general cuz I’m always looking at a screen & I find myself wasting so much time bc of it. 

Eventually my therapist suggested filling out an ADHD assessment & talking to a psychiatrist, bc he did an informal assessment with me & I showed enough signs that he felt it was worth looking in to this. 

I think the assessment is filled out now but I still haven’t been able to bring myself to actually send it in & start this process. It’s been like close to a year since I was supposed to do this & I just keep procrastinating. 

I know I get depressed sometimes but honestly at this point idk if the issue is I have a more serious, clinical form of depression than I anticipated, or if I have ADHD paralysis, which is something I learned of recently. 

I’ve seen that ADHD can also lead to depression & anxiety itself so whether it’s legit depression or ADHD paralysis, I think the assessment is worth sending in.

1izgnk5,1740665461.0,"I feel like this hell never ends (alcohol and meth addiction) Hi guys. Hope you doing well!

I think I just want to share how I feel right now. Any advice would be welcome, but I am starting to lose hope that anyone but myself would ever be able to help me. I am 32 and I have been dealing with this from nearly 15 years. It hasn't always been as bad as in the last 4 or 5 years. 

I just don't know what to do anymore... and think it is actually getting worse. I keep drinking every day, starting with a few beers around 3 hours after I get up then some vodka in the evening. After that the worse eventually comes... I decide that alcohol is not enough and I take a line or two of meth. It is not even bringing me any joy anymore, I just stay up all night staring at my phone or computer... 

I know it is literally poison and that I should not be taking it especially when it does not make me feel good at all anymore, it just causes me very high anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia and all kind of unpleasant physical feelings like dizinness, extreme fatique, very fast heart beat, high blood pressure and many others. On top on everything I do have panic disorder and alcohol and other stimulants like meth make it like 1000 times worse. I know all that yet I cannot stop. I also think I am aware of most of the reasons behing all this and still this is not helping me.

So as I right this post I am drinking beer just to make the bad feelings after the meth I took last night be a bit more bearable. I haven't slept for a second, maybe I do skip like 3 nights of sleep every week and it is really starting to take its toll. I feel extremely weak and tired, I am really not able to do anything productive when I feel like this. I don't know what to do to regain my strenght. My energy level is close to 0. I find it hard to even get out of the house. Not to mention leaving with these feelings would result in an instant panic attack. 

Believe me I have tried, I have been several times in therapy, I have consulted with doctors including psychiatrists, I have tried medication (it had very bad effect). Maybe I just lack the will. I got to the point where I don't feel close to normal if I don't drink a beer or two. I think all this is killing me. I am only 32 years old and at times I literally feel like my life is fading away. Sometimes I wish to just smash my head with something and sometimes I got to admit that I feel like I am about to start crying (and as I said I am a grown 32 years old man). I feel so angry at myself. So helpless. I never believed it would come to this.

He keeps saying that I’m too judgemental and that I’m talking down on him but I’m just hurt and feel ignored. I’ve never been around someone with addiction so I don’t know how to support him. I’ve literally checked every site on google and the only thing I could find is encouraging him to go to therapy and stuff but he said he isn’t ready for that and not ready to stop.

1iy669f,1740518404.0,Unsure of how to swallow this hard pill? I’m not sure how to accept the fact that in active addiction I was a terrible person. Along with the fact that when life stops for me it does not stop for anybody else. (Which I know the universe does not revolve around me but it still manages to hurt) I’m in AA and I’m 100 days sober and I just graduated from rehab and I’m happy with my progress but now that I’m able to truly look back.. I see how much happier people are to have gotten rid of me. That’s not an assumption either. Before cutting these people off I saw the directed social media posts or was just blatantly told by them. I’m happy that they are happy and I know they deserve that and what I did was horrible. I feel terrible still. I have a great friend that I grew up with that I hurt in active addiction and we stopped talking about 2 years ago and while my life was stopped and I was in jail and then rehab.. I got out to see he got married. So anyways I feel horrible for being so much like hitler in how shitty I was with dating and to my friends/ family So just all in all I’m depressed. Not wanting to do much but wallow in self pity which is NOT healthy or what I need to do. So I’m just reaching out here to see if anybody will read all this bullshit and lend me advice on how the fuck to forgive myself or move past this shit.. thanks ,2,4,0,unsure swallow hard pill ? sure accept fact active addiction terrible person . along fact life stops stop anybody else . know universe revolve around still manages hurt aa 100 days sober graduated rehab happy progress able truly look back .. see much happier people gotten rid . assumption either . cutting people saw directed social media posts blatantly told . happy happy know deserve horrible . feel terrible still . great friend grew hurt active addiction stopped talking 2 years ago life stopped jail rehab .. got see got married . anyways feel horrible much like hitler shitty dating friends family depressed . wanting much wallow self pity healthy need . reaching see anybody read bullshit lend advice fuck forgive move past shit .. thanks
1ixknqe,1740451720.0,"You can do it. Believe and try harder. Frankly, it's really the only thing you can do. Why do you relapse?

Because I’m addicted.

Why do you not feel the need to quit?

I do, it’s just I feel that I won’t be able to in the future because after multiple days of being sober I end up relapsing so I feel the need to quit but I also don’t feel the need enough because what’s the point if I’m just gonna do it in the future. And, I hate waiting.

What is the #1 way to control someone or a group that we’ve seen all throughout history?

Fear.

So don’t you think the devil would want you to live in the future and fear what COULD happen?

Yeah, I do.

And wouldn’t the devil want you to live in the past so you think of all the mistakes you’ve previously made also to prevent you from being in the present?

Yeah, the devil would probably do that to stop me from reaching my goals.

So, you would agree that living in the past brings sadness and despair and living in the future only brings anxiety and fear?

Yes.

Would you also agree that since it brings those emotions it’s pointless to waste time on them and the only thing you can really change is the present, right here and now?

I see your logic. Yes, I agree.

Then try not to dwell on the future nor past, the only thing you can change is right now, and right now choose to change and to not do it. Right now you will not relapse. And when the future comes in that moment also choose not to do it. The only way you can change is through discipline, ask God for help, don’t dwell on the past nor future, do your absolute best, do things that take your mind away from the thoughts, pray, make a routine of things that make you a better person, pick up a hobby, do a sport, pick up a side hustle, hang out with friends more. The only person who can break this addiction is YOU!

So first let me say that I myself also smoke weed from time to time so I'm definitely not against weed or something.
Here's the problem. About 8 months ago one of my closest friends graduated and got her master degree and ever since then she has been really  depressed. She doesn't get out of the house and is almost high everyday. She smokes weed everyday, multiple times.
We have had a lot of conversations where she admitted that she is not feeling well and feels addicted to weed but yet she can not stop smoking. She also mentions that her brain is not functioning as well because she's always high (her words not mine).
However then when I'm talking to her and see that she's rolling a joint to smoke and i ask her about it she gets defensive and says that it's not hurting her.
I live in another country so I feel really bad since I have no idea how I can help her. We also have another close friend who is living near her but she also told me that she is afraid to do anything since she doesn't want our friend to distance herself.
Should I talk more about this with her?
Should I wait for her to come to us?
What should I do?
Please tell me if you have any advice I'm all ears and I just want to be able to help my friend.",1,4,0,"help friend weed addiction ? hi everyone . first let say also smoke weed time time definitely weed something . problem . 8 months ago one closest friends graduated got master degree ever since really depressed . get house almost high everyday . smokes weed everyday , multiple times . lot conversations admitted feeling well feels addicted weed yet stop smoking . also mentions brain functioning well always high words mine . however talking see rolling joint smoke ask gets defensive says hurting . live another country feel really bad since idea help . also another close friend living near also told afraid anything since want friend distance . talk ? wait come us ? ? please tell advice ears want able help friend ."

I've hidden my addiction from everyone, when i'm asked about it or someone is suspicious i just lie to their face and gasslight them.

1ix9qu5,1740423311.0,"okay, i’m about to snap so here’s a quick run down of my drug history and my issue:

i started using pain pills at the age of 13.  Started with Lortabs & Vicodin then around 14 went to Percocet and started smoking weed. 15 i was hooked on Opanas, Roxicets (Roxicodone), and Heroin. I quit the pills and stuck with Heroin for another 5-6 years while adding in Cocaine & Crack, Meth, Fentanyl, and pretty much anything i could get. 

Now i’m almost 26, and have been sober from anything hard for quite some time now. I got on Suboxone and was prescribed Klonopin, then Xanax because i have severe anxiety, panic disorder, and social phobia. 

Well my doctor wanted to put me back on Klonopin near the end of last year, and i was totally against it as the Xanax worked faster and more efficiently for the last 3-4 years. she said i was being argumentative and threw me out of the program. So now i’ve been looking for a doctor or psychiatrist to continue me on my much needed nerve medication but they all see my past as a fucking addict, and totally shut me down before i can even say anything. like today for example; a nurse practitioner had my list of medications from the online computer system doctors use, and when she asked why i was seeking treatment with them, i replied “i was hoping for your guys help with my anxiety and -“ she cut me off saying “well im just going to tell you now, you won’t be getting anything from before like any benzodiazepines or anything else” 

i said that was the only thing that worked for me, and has for years but she said it wasn’t happening. this isn’t the first, second, or third time since October 2024 that this kind of conversation has been had between myself and doctors/psychiatrist offices either. 

i just don’t get it.. i can’t leave the fucking house without feeling like i’m going to die of a heart attack from being so stressed out from the sheer fact of not being in my house. 

they’re literally pushing me to do what i’m doing now; buying them off the streets! not to get high, i don’t get a buzz off benzos anymore & haven’t for years. it’s just so i can feel “normal”. (and yes, i take precautions. it’s a family member who gets them prescribed & sells some to me) 

i’m sorry for this long rant, im just beyond upset that they only look at my past, and don’t take into consideration how people change. the suboxone alone should be a clear indication of that!

Being diagnosed with what should have been terminal cancer I got really depressed and started heavy drinking. Now I'm better both health wise and sobriety. Pretty much I just wanted to say no matter how bad, how dark things may seem, it does get better.


Life was good until just 2 years ago,
Now it's something I used to know,
With what I know now,
 I can't sleep,
When those words hit me so deep,
What am I supposed to do?
When it is getting close to me,
Can't explain my view,
Only what sets me free,

It'll be okay when I'm gone,
One day you'll all move on,
Got a dark cloud inside my head,
Wonder if I'll ever smile again,
I'm back to getting wasted,
Missing all my old places,
Everything feels so vacant,
You'll one day get my replacement,

Been a month and a few days,
Showed me it was over in a few ways,
Maybe one day you can let me go,
You know the real me nobody knows,

I know you hate me,
 and I hate me too,
But when I'm fucked up on those drinks,
I can't hear myself cry,
Without them I'm sick,
And we all know why,
Shots and shots untill the bottle runs dry,
I can't let it go,
I try but I always know,
Need to be held close,
When it ends only I know,
Life is just one overdose,

Please don't walk away,
I'm in too much pain to look at your face,
Sick of this disease,
Need to just to feel free,
Shot and shot,
erasing all memories,

It's taking a toll,
Spreading like a rumor untold,
Back with a vengeance,
No longer one step ahead of it,
I just rather sleep today,

First came the war,
now comes the peace,
Guilt and second thoughts haunt dreams,
That burden comes with me,

Soon I'm out of this mess,
Hope you'll miss me

Either way, I'm unable to work much due to this broken shoulder, so I've been laying about at home in god awful pain that I can do nothing besides take tylenol about (which, btw, does not help much.) Both of these factors are making it so SO tempting to relapse.

1iwj8sy,1740341436.0,"all i think about is how much i want xanax all my life i have battled with drugs off all kinds. but xanax was the one that always had my heart. 

i’ve been off xanax for 4 months now. last year, i was using xanax for most of the year. i had relapsed again and it was bad. i was taking so many bars a day, i couldn’t even put a number on it. 

in october, i was driving home from work and kept nodding off. i would wake up on the highway, going 70mph, swerving in between lanes. i didn’t pull over, i just kept waking up, slapping myself thinking i would keep my eyes open this time. well, the last time i nodded off, i didn’t wake up until i had flipped my car four times. i gained consciousness during the last 2 flips of the car. i was upside down but managed to unbuckle my seatbelt. luckily, the windshield was smashed, so i crawled through there while the car caught on fire. 

i couldn’t walk. i could barely move. when i got to the hospital, they told me i fractured my spine, ribs, sternum, and hips. i shattered the heel in my right foot and broke my ankle. i totaled my car, no insurance (i let my insurance lapse because i was dumb as fuck and barely conscious most of the time), i lost my job, i lost my apartment, i lost everything. 

so four months go by, im still not walking due to a complication with my foot surgery. i’m not really doing anything at all, besides sitting at home thinking about all that i could’ve done differently. but my frustration lies with my addiction, because despite all that xanax has brought upon my life, i want it back. 

i want it back more than anything. i would trade all the help i am receiving from my friends and family, the help that’s kept a new roof over my head and my belly full, the help that keeps my insurance paid so i can see doctors, the help that gives me support in life, i would trade it all if i could have xanax back in my life. 

do you hear how selfish that sounds? it’s disgusting, i know. i hate it. i hate that im like this. but on the same note, i also do not care. every day, i think about xanax. how good it made me feel. how it changed how i viewed myself and the confidence it gave me. how complete i was when i had it. i didn’t need a boyfriend, or friends, or support, or food in my stomach, or a job that kept me distracted. i felt like i had everything in the world when i had xanax. 

why, after all of this, all of the years of relapse, almost fucking dying in a car fire, losing my job, finding myself in debt $30,000 because i can’t pay any of my bills anymore and still owe on the car, no longer able to walk normally, everything that offered some sense of security in my life just ripped from my hands, why would i want the thing that irreversibly ruined my life? why can’t i let it go? why do i feel like i absolutely need it to survive? 

i thought that the universe was offering a second chance when i woke up from that car accident. the fact that i woke up at all in time to escape the car is a miracle. i’ve thought about all the reasons why what has happened to me, happened. and it’s all because i let my addiction spiral again. it’s all my fault, i know. but it’s all because i was on xanax. so shouldn’t i hate the drug that caused me so much suffering? 

i’ve been racking my brain trying to think of someone i can hit up who might sell it. i’m worried i’ll buy something pressed with fent. but im willing to take that chance, just to feel it again. the little money i have saved, i’ll spend it on xanax. but before i go too far, i just want to hear what you guys have to say. something to talk me off the ledge, because i know what i want to do is wrong. i know there’s a chance of me relapsing again and possibly dying. 

i know there’s a part of me that wants to beat this. but right now, that’s not the part of me i’m in touch with. please help me. 

TLDR; i’ve been off xanax for 4 months. it irreversibly ruined my life and almost killed me. but right now i don’t care. i want it back. there’s a part of me that wants to beat my addiction, but that’s not the part im feeling right now. before i hit up the plug, i want to hear if there’s anything anyone can say that can help me.

1ivzxgi,1740278330.0,"A sappy thank you to the man who altered his life to save mine As the title suggests, I'm feeling all emotional as I approach my two year's clean mark, and I just wanted to put this out into the world. Its nothing special, just putting my feelings out there. 

I had a lot going on when I was young - I was being sexually abused, gay in a very hick town, and my best friend (and secret boyfriend) ended his own life when we were seventeen. 

On top of all this - I'm a cowboy. I grew up being told men don't have emotions, men don't cry, men need to be tough as nails and theres absolutely no time to talk about your feelings. I followed those arbitrary rules so hard because I was so deeply in the closet. Where else does all this trauma and grief go if it can't be processed? It goes into cocaine. 

When I was eighteen I started partying late after rodeos, and started doing lines to keep the adrenaline going so I didn't have to feel the dissociative crash. It started getting more and more frequent, and it became my go to whenever I started to have a flashback (was later diagnosed with cptsd.) Can't panic when you're getting high. This went on for two years.  

Everyone knew I was doing coke on the weekends, what young cowboy wasn't? But an older bronc rider pulled me aside to ask about it. He could tell I was knee deep in a real problem, which I'm sure I wasn't hiding as well as I thought. 

The thing that made him stick out to me was he was patient. He was gentle and kind, didn't try to ""scare me straight"" or ""knock some sense into me"" like some others did. He was gentle. Thats a word that sticks out lots to me. 

I ended up on his couch for ten months, a lot of it a blur as I fell between active addiction to recovery to relapse and back. He was steady and kind through all of it. Never forced anything on me, never reprimanded me for a relapse, was nothing but supportive. It was groundbreaking. There was this pinnacle of a manly man - a beloved and talented bronc rider, cowboy down to his bones... showing emotion and letting me.. cry? 

He sat with me for three and a half hours on the bathroom floor when I had my first sober flashback. He stayed awake until the sun rose to make sure I was safe after I tried to OD. He comforted me morning to night when I finally let go enough to tell him everything that happened to me. He took care of me like this for ten months. 

When I rallied myself enough to move into my own place - he told me that he had lost his own son to addiction, and that I made him so so proud. It was crazy, this guy I'd known for just over a year loved me like that. But it was his love that got me sober, that got me into therapy, got me comfortable with my sexuality and allowed me to continue to do the sport I love. 

This is just me being eternally grateful for him and saying that things can get better even if its gritty and dirty work. I might not be entirely okay yet, I still spend more days grieving than not, but I can actually do something about it now. He gave me agency, more than anything, and that's such a groundbreaking gift.

1iw1r13,1740284325.0,"Recently Sober I'm recently fully, 100% sober from drugs and alcohol for the first time in over 30 years. This is my story....(warning...long post with many references of drugs and alcohol, if this violates community standards, I'm sorry)

I consciously started drinking when I was 12 years old. It was always innocent at first. We'd sneak a beer or cooler out of Gramma's fridge and share it with friends at the playground, or our friends older siblings would give us a half shot of whatever they were drinking. It was fun. We felt a bit rebelious at that young age. By 15, I was mixing vodka in my Slurpee cup at school every day, and always finding the party on weekends. We all had fake ID's and our one friend's uncle owned a bar. Never thought much of it, just stupid normal teenage antics. It was never a problem. 

I was introduced to cocaine at 16 years old. No one pressured me in to it, I did it of my own volition. It was awesome that first time. I remember that first high. It was the Friday, and my 16th birthday party that night. I bumped a couple rails in the bathroom with one of my friends brothers, and just felt like I was flying. He let me keep the rest as a birthday present. I did a few more rails that night with another friend. We were on top of the world. And from then I was hooked. Though, like booze, it was never a big thing. If it was there, I'd do it. I never sought it out for the first while. Then at 18, it changed. I was doing it every weekend. 

From 18 - 23 I was full out fucked up. A bottle of Jack, Absolut, and Cuervo plus an 8 ball? That was Friday. Saturday was MDMA, Jack, and more coke. The people I did it with were the best friends I ever had. We all worked in similar jobs with similar schedules so it was easy to keep it going. 

At 23, I went to the first funeral of a friend who passed from an OD. I'm not proud of this moment in my life. His girlfriend and I came together - we were both high on coke. We justified it in our heads saying he would've wanted it that way. As the celebration party went on, his dad joined us in doing coke and drinking. His girlfriend dropped some MDMA and started making out with me, and then his dad. I had to take her out of there before his mom unalived her. She crashed at my place, but not before we finished 2 bottles of Jack. (Before anyone asks, nothing happened that night...I told her she wasn't in the right frame of mind to consider doing things with). 

After that, there was more funerals. 2 or 3 a year for a few years. It was always the person that would sober up for a long time who went hard one night thinking they were okay. I OD'd twice, and almost died once. Was in hospital for 3 days the first time. I lied and told my mom it was a heart condition. Was too embarrassed to have her think I was a drug addict. I started to taper down the cocaine to once or twice a month after that. 

In 2008, I was 26. I went to 11 funerals and 5 birthday parties that year. The friends that died tried harder drugs then coke. Usually heroin or oxycontin. They'd get a bad batch or take a lethal dose, and then it was lights out. I never touched that shit, so I was okay. Well, that was my rationale. I moved in with my girlfriend around that time, and she didn't know I was doing cocaine. It was infrequent enough around then that I could easily conceal it. We both drank. I'd traded drinking a bottle of Jack and a bottle of Absolut every night then to a bottle of red wine with dinner and more on weekends. It was social and fun. We felt like we could conquer the world then. I overhaulled the friend group then too, tried to stay away from the friends choosing drugs over moving ahead in life. 

May Long Weekend 2009. I went to Chilliwack to help and old friend move. We were having an amazing weekend. Writing songs with him playing guitar. Partying. Snorting coke. Drinking Jack. Full out rockstar mode. At 930pm in the Saturday, I went to go get more booze. I should've taken the keys with me. I was walking and it wasn't a long walk to the liquor store. I grabbed what I thought would get us through the night (a 40 of Jim Beam), and made my way back. He'd passed out. His girlfriend didn't get off work until 1am. So, I went and sat on a bench in a park drinking my bourbon. I was approached by a woman asking if I was on my way to a party. I said I got locked out of my buddies. She told me to come with her. We drank my bourbon as we walked to her run down motel room. She then broke out some coke, and we drank and got high. She told me she wouldn't charge me if I wanted to have sex because she drank most of the bourbon. I noped out of there in a hurry. 

I quit doing cocaine in that moment. I figured if my actions were leading me to do blow in a seedy motel with a hooker, I should re-evaluate my life choices. And I did. It has been almost 16 years since then, and save for a couple pot brownies and a couple hits from a weed pipe, I've not touched a drug since. People around me state this is the thing they are most amazed by. 

I quit drinking for a time then too. That lasted until shortly before my 28th birthday. Roughly 5 months fully sober. I was okay to have a few drinks to celebrate my annual spin around the sun. I mean, why not. I didn't go hard, but I for sure did over do it. And from that point I was back on the sauce. 

In late 2012, I moved from Vancouver to Northern Manitoba for work. I looked at it as an opportunity to re-imagine myself. I tried to sober up. That didn't work so well. At one bar, Heineken was $4/bottle. Halloween night, I went HARD. My hands nor bottle were never empty until they ran out of Heineken. That was it for me. I drank almost every day for 6 months. It was the only real friend I had there. My next closest friend was 8 hours east. The closest city was 13 hours south. It was me and Jim Beam. That's it. I went for a walk one night. It was -45°C out. I walked the train tracks, depressed and alone, drinking from the bottle. I sat down on the train bridge over the frozen solid North Saskatchewan River. I dropped the empty bottle and watched it smash on the ice below. That was it, I was going to jump. I was a drunk, and being there couldn't help me. Luckily, someone I met saw me and stopped me. They drove me home and made sure I was warm. I moved back to Vancouver shortly after that happened. 

I cut back on the drinking from that moment until I turned 35. I had a kid. I had a good job. Life was great. But my 35th birthday was a drunken festival of me. And from then until this past weekend, I've not been okay when drinking. I wasn't a daily or even weekly drinker, but I'd go hard when I did. During COVID, my father passed. He said to me on his last day alive was that I have a kid now and I should give up whatever vices I had to focus on being a dad. Rich advice from the man that never did the same until it was too late for him. 

This past weekend, my girlfriend of 7.5 years and I went to spend time at a cabin with some friends. From the moment we arrived, there was never not a drink in my hand. Whiteclaw mostly. First night was chill. We got in late, and didn't go to hard. 2nd night? Oh boy. I. Went. Hard. I remember parts of the night, certain conversations, certain activities, etc. but I don't recall everything. I'm told I was belligerent, that I came down on friends for past things, and that I refused to go upstairs to check on my girlfriend. The problem is, I don't not believe it. You know that scene in The Simpsons were Homer imagines he was talking to the President at an old time cocktail party? Yeah, in my mind that was how I thought I was when drinking. It was a long car ride home. My girlfriend gave me the riot act. And this week I've been in my own head. 

I need to get better and be a better version of me. And as long as I have alcohol, that isn't going to happen. I've talked to my doctor about finding counselling and supports, but the wait time is extensive. This is going to be a difficult journey. And I hope I can get through it.

1ivyfq0,1740273617.0,"Long Term Ketamine Abuse For starters, I’m in my early 20’s currently. Over the past two years I have struggled with severe Ketamine abuse, on multiple occasions to the point of unbearable physical pain (stomach cramping and bladder) which has put me in urgent cares and the ER on multiple occasions. It started while I was recovering from Cocaine addiction, it had the opposite effect on me which I enjoyed and I was still able to fill my nasal fixation. I had been kicked out of my home and while having significant savings, was unable to find housing for a long while. During that period alone I spent over half of my remaining savings on Ket, days blurring together and my bank account going unchecked as I continued to pick up more and more, even staying at my at the time plugs house overnight on occasion high off my ass. I ended up finding a place to stay, but being away from my family only made it easier to keep consuming more. I progressed into bulk buying after retaining a job for a while, which is when I started doing it to a completely vile extent (this is well over a year ago) and ended up with severe cramping and bladder issues. I continued using it throughout due to thinking the ket subdued the pain and it was from something else (it obviously wasn’t). After realizing where the issues stemmed from I significantly lowered my usage for a moth or two, still using around a gram a day which shockingly was minimal for me. A few months ago I managed to go two weeks sober, which I did solely to pass a drug test for a new job. After getting the job I relapsed, spending more and more again and getting to the point where I’d leave work to go pick up and get high. I ended up losing that job likely due the absences and have been without stable work ever since, still managing to get high almost every day down to my last penny. Nearing the end of this month I have $1 to my name, my monthly spend for ketamine being nearly double what I pay for rent. As much as I can bear to go without it, I am in such close quarters with the ability to keep abusing it. 4+ plugs within a 15 min radius, one of which living walking distance. No matter what time of day or night, I know I can get it from one of them. This cycle has ruined a lot of things in my life, and in that regard only I am to blame. Dishonesty, hiding away in my room and away from these issues, and never going to the meetings people forward to me. I am coming to the full realization that I am giving up everything for one thing, and that I have prioritized this one thing over everything else for so god damn long. If there’s anyone on this sub who has dealt with this extreme abuse in regards to ketamine specifically I’d like to hear your experience or advice, whether you’re in active addiction or recovery.

Backstory: I'm on a sober journey from alcohol. He's been super supportive, especially as he only drinks rarely. Also of note: he's from Italy and he's been in the country for 25 years.

Last week I relapsed and drank a bottle of red wine we had in the house - Valpolicella, probably $10 from Trader Joe's. He knew this, I felt guilty and awful about it happening at all. I don't remember if I finished the bottle (probably) or if I put the partial bottle somewhere. He asks me about it the next day. I genuinely don't remember. The line of questioning made me feel guilty and uncomfortable. Fast forward to tonight he asks me where the bottle of red wine is and I'm like what? And he said the one from last week that was already open. I said I have no idea. Then 5 minutes later he says ""what should I drink?"" and I say ""whatever you want"", and he says he feels like Valpolicella. I gesture towards the cabinet and ask if he wants me to see if we have any and he kind of chuckles and says no.

At that point I'm furious and feel ashamed so I say I'm done and walk away. He comes into the bedroom to ask why I'm so upset. The subsequent conversation was pointless. He claims he doesn't know and said ""was it about the wine?"". YES, it was about the wine. Why did he insist on making me feel like shit over and over again? To bring it up 3 times? I asked why he insisted on making me feel like shit about this. He played dumb. He said ""I'm sorry you're so easily offended"".

It's no secret I slipped up last week but I don't remember. There's no purposeful withholding of information about this potential partial bottle of wine.

I feel so many things I don't know where to start. The disrespect, the guilt, the shaming, the blame, the insistence that he has NO IDEA why I'd be upset. I'm at a loss for words and can't see this situation clearly.

1ivklon,1740236502.0,"I feel like I will never get over my ketamine addiction I started first during summer 2024 during free parties expecting it to not be worse than mdma or weed, except I quickly realise that I really wanted more, unlike anything I ever felt . I took some again until I ended in a psychiatric hospital for other reasons.

My stay a the clinic was pretty traumatizing, especially since I was trans but not officially yet. I basically came out of the clinic worse than when I entered, in order to be prepared for my entrance in an art school I was very excited about. At the same time my girlfriend, who I was very attractive to broke up with me. Then I had to move to a different city in which I didn’t know anybody. 

It is at that time that I started taking ketamine again, but this time alone at my place and then I stopped going outside, or doing anything basically, though I tried taking my own life three times including one time when I ended up in an hospital.

I enventually stopped and started going back to school and working on my homework’s seriously, which actually showed me I was actually talented and gave me hope.

Until today, when I messaged my dealer once again even though I tried everything not to. I’m scared of my future and really disappointed in myself, even though I feel like my situation isn’t that bad and that I’m the only one to blame

We used to be hardcore drug addicts in our past and we decided that we quit after we got together. We did drugs a couple times at the beginning of our relationship and then slowly got rid of those things, we stopped going to parties, stopped talking to people who still use and we didn’t feel the need of doing drugs again. 

Recently life got a little tough, he got two jobs(barista & dj), moved by himself and I noticed he started getting distant from me. I always go see him, check on him and offer him all my love and support. 
Yesterday after I went to his place to hang out a little, I went home, everything seemed fine.
Today he came to my place, we got into a little fight because I told him I felt “something’s off” and he told me he did drugs all night. 
I couldn’t believe it, I was very disappointed and confused. I really want to save him because I don’t want addiction to take him again…
He said that he did it because he feels lonely and stressed out lately and wants to move together with me .
Do y’all think it’s a good solution to move together during this time? I’m so scared and I just want to live a peaceful life with him. 
I hate drugs so much and addiction is a bitch but I appreciate that he told me “I need help and I’m willing to change” which is a good sign at least.

She’s been a functioning heroin user for 10 plus years—early 30s, smoker, pays all her bills, and takes care of everything, including raising her daughter (who just left for college). She’s never once asked me or anyone else for anything, her family asks her for stuff All the time and depends on her plus she has animals she takes care of too so she’s always busy but then at the same time her family gives her shit constantly  because of her addiction and it’s just became a loop and because of her use, her health has suffered over the years too. 

The most recent issue has been with her throat—she hasn’t been able to eat solids for six months, and they had to stretch her throat. She’s had liver problems before and gets really sick whenever anything hits her. The sad part is that she’s still beautiful, incredibly creative, funny and full of ideas, but she isolates herself completely. She refuses relationships because she says she doesn’t want to drag anyone down. Whenever I ever go with her to doctor’s appointments they make her feel like an addict I’ve literally watched a doctor say he wouldn’t help because she is an addict. She has terrible anxiety and everyone just expects her to fix it. 

She’s tried to get sober before, but when she did, she said time slowed down —minutes felt like hours, and she had no new routine to fill the void. She relapsed. Today, she took the step to try methadone.

She can’t afford inpatient treatment, and no one in her support circle (including me) has that kind of money.

this drug has such a grip on me. it's like nothing i've ever done before. it's just so much harder to quit this than it was to quit alcohol. 

most of my old and some new friends have either distanced themselves from me or quit talking to me all together. my one best friend told me it's hurting him to see how much i've changed bc of this. he said he feels like hes losing another friend to drugs and alcohol. my other best friends death anniversary is coming up. idk why my brain can't comprehend this as my low. i mean, i have a place 2 live - i'm not homeless anymore, but i really dont have anyone that isnt just lookin 2 hook up. idk what i've become and if i'll ever be mentally strong enough to quit.

I moved states, to Florida.. surrounded by the sound of waves and the comfort of the sun, I loved my life, the life I finally made for myself. I was a productive member of society, a role model mother, I had amazing work ethic, even winning trips to Vegas and awards for my passionate work as a stylist. Eventually I ended up getting married, and settling in, content without chaos, for once. Normalcy, if you will.  After some time, my husband quickly began to change, forcing me to endure months and months of abuse… not physically, but mentally. Throughout my pregnancy, and right after.. post baby I realized I was suffering with major postpartum depression,
On top of my bipolar depression. I felt like I was always sad, resenting my husband for stealing my time away- that should be spent bonding with our new baby, instead I was depressed, unable to cook, clean, laugh, bond… I was raising three children who watched me do nothing but cry.. the only thing that would cheer me up was my 7 year old, with the sweetest soul, and a heart of pure gold. Wiping my tears and wrapping me in her arms, how pathetic can I get, I thought. I remember begging my husband to love me, or asking him why he didn’t. So much, I felt I was forced to go through, eventually… I thought I couldn’t do it anymore. I hated coming home to be forced to sleep on the couch, or on a child’s bunk bed, or told I’m not loved or wanted anymore with zero reasoning as to why. Or when I was moved back home, states away by my husband- then two weeks later he picked me back up in a U-Haul and moved me home. The back and forth and constant questioning made me so resentful.. I just wanted love, and a full family. I wanted to be surrounded by all the tiny toes, and laughter.. but, one day is all it took. One bad choice of mine. I relapsed.. which is the worst day of my life. That was a year ago, almost a year and a half. Looking back, time flew by. How did I get here? So where along the way I lost myself & everything I had built…. I had taken everything for granted, such as days that I could have spent with my kids. But I spent it getting high in the bathroom.. I was so lost, blinded by the drugs. Eventually I decided to leave the man I loved the most.. now over a year later, I struggle everyday, hating myself and sitting in my own disaster of a life.. drowning in regret and guilt. Why did I do this? Why did I leave? Although, I know I wasn’t treated the best, my brain wants to trick me and blame myself, and that I’m the bad one.. I loved my husband more than anything, more than myself, but he made me hate everything about me.. fill my soul full of anger, and hate. My children are no longer together, and my family is forever broken.. my life is miserable and I can’t help thinking, how I would go back and choose to stay, even if it only meant- my family being whole.. I’m scheduled for treatment (rehab) this Friday, and I hope I find a way to heal, bring myself back to reality, and built my self esteem again. I deserve it, my children deserve it, I’m just so disappointed and as confusing as it is, I use because of the problems I’ve caused because I was using?

1itjkcb,1740006543.0,"talking about my experience with addiction to weed and nicotine Hey everyone, just felt like writing my experience down and sharing it.

I first tried vaping in March of 2023, but it hurt my throat when I inhaled it, so I was like ""wow, that hurt, I'm never vaping again. thank god."" Beginning in May of 2023, I began to start using weed, and by September, I began using it a lot more often. It wasn't until November of 2023 when I got my first vape buzz, and my throat was alright because I had smoked a cigarette just a minute prior. It hit so hard and I felt so relaxed and ""high"" and felt like I was ""tripping"". I closed my eyes and let it ride out for like a minute. After that, I was hooked. I got my first vape a week or two later. I would hit it instead of getting high on weed, as kind of a balance, and it was alright. Then, I quit for probably a few months with ease.

I got back into vaping probably around April after I became depressed. I would wake up, go to school, then go to work until 8, 9, or 10 pm, go home, immediately go into my room, pop 40 mg of weed, and then sit and listen to my records. Then, when my high was peaking, and I had the right song on, I would hit my vape for 4 seconds, exhale, wait like 5 - 20 seconds, and then repeat about 5 - 6 times to get a huge head rush. I would feel like I was tripping, just like people did in the 60s with acid and music. It felt really good and I looked forward to doing that every single night from probably April - late August. I tried quitting a few times but couldn't bring myself to it.

In early September, I decided I wanted to quit vaping because my lungs were kind of hurting and so was my chest and my head (I had migraines like 2-5 times a week beginning in March so vaping didn't help it). I finally had 2 or 3 days where I didn't get high or vape, but then I had a sudden panic attack while being high. I hit my vape like 6 times per usual and then noticed my heart rate wasn't going down and was speeding up, which gave me my scariest moment in my life. I thought I was dying and my heart rate was probably at 120-150 bpm for two hours. Since then, I have not felt the same and am always anxious and tense, and I haven't felt relaxed since before the attack. My mind is also constantly foggy and spacey all the time thanks to the weed and vaping.

However, I have not hit a vape since then, nor done any nicotine, and I stopped using caffeine as it increases my heart rate. I quit doing weed as much (currently a month and a half clean) but I'm still depressed and anxious and eat a shit ton. I do wish that I could go back in time and not vape but I wish that I could still get high, as it truly relaxed me.

Anyway, that's it. Sorry if some parts are written horribly, it's hard for me to concentrate and write and think. Post your thoughts if you got any! I like talking about it to people.

What a journey it has been. I haven’t posted on this sub for years but just rediscovered it recently and remembered how amazing this community is.  

Around 4-5 years ago I remember posting here almost weekly either lying about how well I was doing or about my latest relapse and every single one was filled with excuses, explaining why it happened. I eventually deleted that account because being able to look at my profile and physically see my self destructive cycle was too real. Overall, I had what I label now as “terminal uniqueness” which meant my addiction was different, that what I was going through was inescapable when, in reality, it was another excuse to not get better. 

3 years ago today I checked myself into a detox center and broke the cycle. I have gone through countless tests and experienced a lot of pain but the one thing I haven’t done was drink because of it. 

As of today I have a fiancé, a baby on the way, a house and a blossoming career. I honestly never thought any of these things were in the cards for me but it’s amazing what we can accomplish when we aren’t actively destroying ourselves.

I wasn't perfect. I relapsed.

I like the sentiment that as long as you’re still breathing, it’s not too late to turn things around. But I worry I’m an exception.

1jgagw8,1742538414.0,"My 6 Month Journey... a journaling exercise. I’m 6 months sober. I’m lucky. My wife has always been aware and sympathetic of my addiction. She saw it happen. We met in college. She saw me go from binge drinking at 21 and 22 to full-on alcoholic at 32 (now 33).

In my recovery, meditation and journaling have been pivotal for keeping me grounded and mindful. So I’m typing this for myself. If you want to read it and engage, I’d love to chat too. Group work is part of recovery. Trigger warnings for alcohol, pills, infertility, probably other stuff too, not sure where this will go.

My relationship with substances:

My family consists of social drinkers, and a few drug users. My parents were social drinkers from what I remember growing up. My mom was 19 when she gave birth to my sister, 3 years prior to me. My dad is one year older than her. That said, my dad has alluded to drinking a lot in his 20s, but never said it was an issue or talks about it.

First drink like ""haha"" from a bottle was when I was young, there's a picture, I think I was 4. I don't want to ask my mother… she feels guilty. But my first beer by myself was at 10. Grew up in a small town, so my sister’s friends were my friends, or at least I hung out with them. Her being 3 years older, summer before high school was when kids started going to ""high school"" parties.

My parents had the mentality of ""we'd rather let you do it and know the details than have you sneaking around to do something stupid."" Which, at the age I am now, I respect that. I think the idea was right, just poorly executed.

My sister had friends over to drink often and I joined. Casually at first and then more and more. I was always big for my age—weight and height.

By the time I was in high school, they were getting me and my friends 30 racks and a handle of vodka for parties... sometimes MORE. I would drink the leftovers from the weekend over the week, and when my parents asked I'd just say, ""we drank most of it and want to have back up"" or something, but we got it...

During this time, I wasn't really living at home. We did go to my house some weekends and party there, but my parents didn't love that. I had a buddy whose parents were super lax about partying and really everything... girls could stay over, etc.

I was sleeping there most nights of the week, smoking and drinking. At 16 I got my first car and that just gave me access to a whole new world.

Let's take a step back though. This sounds really concerning. Meanwhile, I was living a functional binging alcoholic life at 16. Drinking hard at night, wake up and get my shit done. Rinse and repeat. I seemed like ""a good kid."" I got mostly As and Bs with an occasional C. I got a job the week I legally could start work, had off and on girlfriends, good friends, teachers liked me, work liked me, was on the baseball team until I got a job.

I did see a drug counselor at school, but I always lied, just used it as an excuse to miss things and to get attention. I wasn't taking it seriously, I was having fun and not thinking about future consequences. Addiction doesn't affect ME. NO WAY.

Hopping a bit all over, but I need to introduce another layer to all of this. My job gave me even more access. I worked at a particular drug store with 3 letters. So to level set, I'm now drinking heavily and spending most of my money on that, weed, and chasing tail.

Well the internet showed me [erowid.com](http://erowid.com) when I was 16 and I discovered that dextromethorphan can be used recreationally. Guess who has a ton of that? Guess who had easy access to steal it?

I was buddies with the managers, I went into the office with them during close to chat (door open) while they counted money. I took note of the blind spots on the cameras. I kept a strict schedule and did what I was told. If you're predictable, so are the people around you.

I stole a ton of DXM products from there and surrounding stores. Same brand and not. This went on while I was 16 and 17. I would take low doses during the day and then a lot at night. The drinking stopped. The smoking mostly stopped. I was full-on addicted to it. 120 was my waking dose. 8 of those 15mg red devils. This was a pleasant buzz where I could function, but some days I would get ballsy and overdo it. A buddy took me home ""sick"" more than once because I decided to take too much and was noticeably robo walking.

My god as I type this there is so darn much... What a long strange trip it's been.

When I was 17, there was a concert I passed out at a state away. My buddy had to call my parents. They got me from the hospital. I played it off as ""I tried weed for the first time, I'm sorry it was so scary"" bull. We all knew it was, but I wasn't admitting otherwise.

For a few months I lived sober. I gained freedoms back slowly. I was going to college in a few months anyway.

The college I went to is a large party campus. Drinking picked right back up. This experience is not very unique and I'm not going to go into the details of 4 years of binge drinking and occasional drug use in college. I can tell you during this time it was the same schtick as high school. Party hard, but get my shit done.

I did start to notice the world is getting bigger. Consequences were bigger on this stage. Life was getting more serious. I lost girlfriends over the sauce, missed classes, was late to work. To me it was still just a giant party.

The key difference was, I found a larger crowd like me. A friend group that based all activities around drinking. It was easy to be a degenerate when everyone around is acting the same way.

In junior year, I met my absolutely lovely wife. I had long-term relationships before, but boy I fell head over heels for her.

By the time I met her, I was fully-blown drinking at work-study and before class alcoholic. I hid it well for a while. During our junior and senior year it wasn't uncommon for us to grab a drink before/after class even if it was like an 11 a.m. class... With this being a fact, it wasn't hard for me to drink all day.

We never lived with each other until the summer of our senior year, before we moved to my home state in our first apartment. I got a great job at a tech company (I'm still there, 10 years last week) while she finished up grad school in the drivable state we went to school in. Guess what I did? Work and drink. I never knew it was noticeable until a girl I got close with told me the day she met me she could smell me but never after that, so she thought I had a lot the day before or something.

Well the girlfriend moves in after grad school and real life sets in. Drinking is causing havoc. The last 12 years of my life have been on-and-off alcoholism. Smoking too, but that has never been an issue for me and is not destructive like my drinking. So when I was smoking and not drinking, those were ""good times""..... white-knuckling it and refusing to get help.... this went up until about—

Fast forward to six months ago... I was horribly depressed, my anxiety was at an all-time high.

My cycle was basically have a full week of drinking and say I will stop after Sunday. On Monday pop a Xanax to try to fight withdrawals… but when I lost to cravings, I was just full-on drinking on Xanax.

Then Tuesday I would feel like shit for failing. Usually get through most of the day, but by dinner time end up telling my wife I’m weaning off. Then I would have like 8–15 drinks (anything I could get), sneaking most. Which wasn’t enough for me. So when I couldn’t sleep at night, I’d take an Ambien.

Then by Wednesday I already drank most of the week (in my mind) and I would just go to full-on drinking.

Rinse and repeat. I was actually doing well at my job. I was drinking enough to get by during the day, then hit it hard at night. I work remotely so smell and access were not an issue.

To add to this, my wife and I had been trying to conceive for about 1.5 years by that time. My wife was wanting to do IVF. I'm terrified and selfish and don’t want my party to stop. I don't want that at all. I was satisfied with me getting drunk, us having sex, and me just neglecting to give anything constructive to our relationship.

I went to bed most nights not wanting to wake up in the morning. I got past the idea part and had started making plans. Never put them in motion.

THE GOOD PART:

Today is now 6 months and 8 days sober. After one last vacation we had planned, I took leave from work to get sober.

I started an intensive outpatient program (IOP) at a recovery facility. I didn't want to go. I almost didn’t go the first day. Let me tell you, it saved my life and is one of the best things to happen to me.

Intensive is the proper word to describe it. Three group sessions a week, at 3 hours EACH, and 1 hour with your individual clinician.

The group was 8–12 people. We started with meditation, then psychoeducation, and then individual check-ins/shares. The time commitment works twofold as it physically occupies your time, but also you’re getting a ton of information about addiction and coping mechanisms. Legit, the curriculum was super helpful for life skills… not even just addiction. Communication styles, mindfulness, relapse psychology, coping techniques, healthy relationships, CBT, boundaries etc.

It changed my life. It changed how I view things, interact with people, respond to situations. This coupled with the clarity of mind from not drinking and getting on the right meds... It was like that freaking Limitless movie the first few months—you couldn't touch me. That’s how it felt, lol. Obviously it wasn’t that glorious.

I meditate 2+ times a day now, journal most days, a lot of exercise. I’m doing even better at work, I've picked up a couple dope hobbies. I fell back in love with my wife and I feel our connection is the strongest it's ever been. We did a lovely family session with my clinician.

Things I'm working on with my therapist:

My shame and guilt for feeling like I wasted my 20s and missed valuable moments and ruined moments with my drinking. My wife is a saint.

I was consistently sexually abused as a child by a neighbor. To be determined what that means in relation to my use and how to truly process it. I never have.

I have a great relationship with my parents still. They tried to parent me through my 20s and I didn’t realize it and how much stress it caused me. Getting sober and getting therapy and realizing what more common boundaries are... I’m hella resentful for that and for access to booze. This is a big one.

I can say I’m genuinely the happiest I’ve been in 10 years. I have bad days like anyone else. That said, my wife and I re-found love, my job is very good and interesting enough, I have a nice home, a good dog, spare time. I’m living a lot of people’s dreams. In IOP and therapy, they say not to look at it like that, but it’s hard not to factor that in.

The biggest change is obviously how in touch I am with my emotions. Others’ too. I shit you not, friends I've known 10–12 years from college... it was like talking to them sober for the first time. Wild.

I’ve lost 50 lbs in these 6 months. I have confidence back. I love hiking with my dog and go 3–4 times a week, went all through the winter... snow and everything.

I still have my moments, but I’m genuinely happy.

A Minor Hiccup:

Ten days ago, I took DXM… two days after we found out our first IVF transfer failed. I was heartbroken, but my wife was devastated… she completely broke down.

Since getting sober, I’ve watched her sister have a baby… my sister have a baby… and now her other sister is pregnant. Our friend groups are full of babies too. The grief isn’t just about the transfer… it’s the pain of ambiguous loss. We’re mourning something we never had… and it’s everywhere.

She coped by drinking, which triggered me. I couldn’t drink… I’m on naltrexone and wouldn’t feel it anyway. Plus, I didn’t want to betray that line. But DXM felt like a loophole… not alcohol… not traceable… so in the moment, it felt justifiable.

I haven’t told my wife. She’s overwhelmed… and my therapist, who’s also been through IVF, agrees it’s best to wait until things settle. It was a one-time slip… and I’ve worked through it in therapy.

This was also a few days before a work trip to… of all places… Las Vegas… my nerves were on fire.

I took this one in stride. I told my therapist the events and she said, ""I'm not surprised at all with the events following up to it,"" or something like that.

Shout out to my clinician who is an amazing person and great at what she does. She has been so helpful to me and even my wife. When I told her about the IVF stuff, she offered a family session... really to get my wife in there. Of course we talked about my recovery, but the majority was her talking gal to gal. One person who did IVF and one doing it. It was amazing. That meant so much to me. After the failed transfer, she texted my wife to ask if she wanted to talk. For free. On her own time. What a rock star!

1jgcb5i,1742546854.0,"To break the cycle I know I've had a problem for a while but the mind, if anything, is extremely adept at making up excuses. Last augustus I made a resolution to not drink again, I started frequenting this sub. I was doing pretty well, I made it to 19 days until I went to a music festival. At some point I more or less felt pressure to try a beer, but I actually didn't like the taste and didn't drink more than half a glass.

In a way I felt proud, I had managed to moderate myself and if I can moderate myself  then I can start drinking socially here and there, right? I think I don't need to elaborate on how that worked out, it was a gradual but steady descend into a misuse of alcohol. Speaking of alcohol misuse, is there ever any amount that isn't a misuse? This poison we willingly digest and somehow society has embraced it and even glorifies it. But I digress. 

This winter I reached an all time low. In general I am not a winter person, I am extremely prone to darkness and cold and the loneliness I experienced this winter is by far the worst I ever faced before. My only comfort? Yep, you guessed it. It starts out with just a drink a day, and then two. At some point you're starting to worry but you tell yourself, as long as I'm worrying about it I'm no alcoholic, an alcoholic wouldn't question it. It's mind boggling to me how far the mind can go to justify your terrible habits. I did two whole bottles of wine in an evening and I felt disgusted, so utterly disgusted. In a drunken rage I threw away the opened bottle of rum I had. The worst part to me is that the hangover I had the following day was actually rather mild. I had gotten used to alcohol to the point that two entire bottles gave me just a light headache. 

Since then I've been stuck in a cycle of not drinking for a couple of days, giving in, telling myself the next morning that I'll never drink again only to do it again the very same evening or two days later. I'm tired of it, I don't want to drink anymore, but I can't break the cycle. If I can make it through a working week without drinking I will eventually just relapse on a gloomy day in the weekend.

1jfvf80,1742494300.0,"Proud but struggling Hi all, hope everyone is having a peaceful day. Next week I’ll hit 90 days. It feels pretty surreal, but maybe not in the way you’d think. While I do feel proud of myself I also feel like 90 days is such a small feat. It just feels so daunting and unbelievable that I have the whole rest of my life to go.

I know we are not supposed to think like this but it’s a really tough mindset to get out of. The whole “just say no to the next drink” or “I’m not drinking just for today” mindset does help temporarily, but it’s not super realistic for me as I know that along with today, I also cannot drink any other day for the rest of my life. Yes I can say no to the next drink, but I also know I have to say no to all of the other drinks too. I absolutely feel more anxious and depressed now that I’m sober and I know that’s just because I’m facing all of these feelings I’ve pushed down for years but I’m so exhausted.

On top of this existential crisis I’m having, I just spent the weekend visiting a friend in a different state who had promised a sober environment but didn’t end up following through. Both Saturday and Sunday ended up being pretty heavy drinking days for her and her boyfriend and it was really frustrating and disappointing. Especially because I did not ask my friend to have a sober/ alcohol free weekend, she offered. I had told her that I’m fine being in an environment where there is casual drinking (meaning 1-2 drinks at the beach or dinner) but I cannot be in a “party” environment where people are drinking to get drunk. She insisted that I have nothing to worry about. We have been planning this weekend for a while and I was super excited to visit! This was my first time meeting her bf, and it’s very obvious that he has a drinking problem. This has also been an added stressor and just has me extra worked up…

I can want a drink and then feel deeply whatever emotion was causing that urge for an hour and then realize— had I had a drink I would be hungover now and feeling like crap because one drink only lasts an hour… and then I would need more. 

But the biggest thing is that I realized alcohol wasn’t the problem it was my solution to whatever problems I had inside. If I don’t like my life I can work my ass off to change it and even if that doesn’t work at least I can respect myself to say that I tried. Whatever tough shit—and there’s always tough shit… if it’s not something today it’s something three months from now or tomorrow—whatever tough shit is happening is what I need to fix. Drinking isn’t going to help. People post oh I hate my life just as much now at 2 years sober and it’s like yeah just quitting drinking won’t magically fix your life. 

I started  gratitude journal… where even on “miserable days” where I worked hard or felt really depressed or things felt unfair—I still write down ten moments from the day or ten things I’m grateful for and it actually has rewired my brain to look for those things. It works.  

Also, getting off social media.. for the most part. I have an addictive personality so I had to delete it off my phone and just keep it on my desktop and just from that my ability to sustain focus—my mental fortitude has improved.

1jfntef,1742473915.0,"Week 3 and I almost relapsed Today marks my 3rd week of sobriety, but I nearly gave in last night, where I live there was a big thunderstorm right before and during I left work and the drive I do to get home takes an hour so i left 30 minutes early, still traffic was slower which was fine been doing the drive for almost 2 years. The issue began when I stopped by a Walmart on the way to buy a few things like a raincoat for my dog for her nightly walk, as I left the Walmart back on the road the storm pretty much stopped but caused a intersection light to not function (blinking red) and the intersection itself already causes buildup so I sat there for nearly 30 minutes waiting to finally pass, I became angry, and I got home somehow even later than usual and this was me leaving 30 minutes early, walked my dog but still felt angry, and her tugging me around cause she just has a lot of energy and lots of rabbits or dogs are around the neighborhood didn't help. What did nearly did me was when I was in my room it was already almost 9pm and all I did was walk my dog, I wanted to read comfortably without worrying about time, I wanted to clean, I wanted to make something to eat, and my head started giving me bad thoughts, thoughts I haven't felt in the 3 weeks I quit drinking, so I drove to a nearby gas station to get drinks, but thankfully they didn't sell any, so I pumped gas and drove to a Burger King instead but didn't even eat half of what I bought. I didn't enjoy last night, I was filled with anger towards myself the way I acted, it was selfish. I wrote down how I truly felt about myself in a journal, and I went off, but I felt calmer after I did, ended up burning the page with a lighter.

I’m not proud of this at all and i’m struggling with forgiveness. I have impulse issues thanks to my mental health so the Naltrexone really has helped me with my drinking impulses. I’ve been able to say no to alcohol for about 2 weeks and then something just snapped in me. The naltrexone worked so i didn’t get drunk just got a bit sick and warm. I’m just disappointed I didn’t listen to my inner voice that has been telling me no recently :(,4,8,0,relapsed 26f currently naltrexone . really rough day monday ended downing 3 white claws . proud struggling forgiveness . impulse issues thanks mental health naltrexone really helped drinking impulses . able say alcohol 2 weeks something snapped . naltrexone worked get drunk got bit sick warm . disappointed listen inner voice telling recently

I was a little over 2 months sober right at the end of last year. I felt decent, but deep down I knew I was waiting for an excuse to drink again. 2.5 months later and I can barely remember what I’ve done so far this year except drink and dig my self-made hole deeper. 

I remember how awful the first few days were during my 2 month stint, but in a few ways this time feels a little worse. I’m ashamed by my relapse, all the texts I sent, and the couple IG stories I posted. It’s like I simply can’t learn my lesson, despite my drinking ruining so much of my life and my relationships.

I’ve just felt like curling up into a ball and crying my eyes out all damn day. I know I need support from people, but I’m scared to damage more relationships.

1jf72lj,1742416500.0,"It Can Always Get Worse I made a post a few weeks ago commenting how bummed I was about losing a few hundred dollars on 4 day bender after close to 8 weeks sober.

Well, I stayed sober afterwards for a week only to relapse again and this time was even worse. I blew through what remained of my tax return, over a grand, on bars and Ubers. Left my car downtown for a week and walking my kid to bus stop in the morning instead. The car ended up being towed and since I blew through all my money I haven’t had a chance to even get it out as I no longer have the money to do so, it just racks up $40 a day. My kid has missed multiple soccer practices and a game because of this.

The depression, sadness and shame I feel have hit an all time low. Luckily my Mom stays with me so I have some help but she can only do so much. 

I’ve let everyone down again, let my son down again, and let myself down again. I just see no way out of this hole. Alcohol just has a hold of me to where I think I can have a drink and I blink and it’s a week later and everything is gone or ruined. I just keep thinking back to those sober weeks and wish more than anything I could go back. I’ve been laying in bed playing things over and over.

I’m 3 days sober but it feels like I have forever to go. No car, no job, and as a single father a son who solely depends on me.

1jem21b,1742348722.0,"Quitting made me realize… It sounds counterintuitive, but quitting actually made me realize there’s a serious problem here. 

Quite honestly I decided to “take a sustained break” to work off the 20 pounds I’ve gained over the last couple of years, ever since my glass of wine a night habit snowballed into a bottle of wine a night habit. 

I naively thought wow with a few weeks completely AF I bet my skin will be glowing and I will be shedding weight like crazy and killing it at work. 

Wow was I wrong. I sit here tonight, reflecting on how lucky I’ve been to escape any serious life damage from my drinking escapades, which have been the S.O.P. in my life pretty much since like 18 (35F now). I’m freaking exhausted. I’m doing the bare minimum at work, laying around like a complete bum in the evenings, anhedonia, kinda depressed but more just numb. And my face is broken out like an actual teenager. Actually worse than when I was a teenager. What’s up with that? 

I guess I didn’t realize my habits were as truly problematic as they are. Our society cloaks A BENDER in socially smiled upon phrases like “brunch culture”, “the foodie scene”, shit, even commonly the guise of “professional networking”. 

I’ve done so much reading over the last three weeks, I’ve read every post on this thread, I’ve researched what happens to the body when you quit, I’ve read medical threads on here from nurses/doctors talking about the rise in young patients with liver disease. It’s sad, and it’s really really scary. I’ve seen both of my parents struggle with AUD, why the hell did I think it would possibly be any different for me? Because I wear a sundress when I do it? Wtf. 

I thought I was taking a break to lose weight but wow the veil has been lifted. Will give myself the first 30 days to laze around and process these thoughts, then I’m getting out there. I want to find a community and likeminded people and create a completely different freaking reality for myself.

I don’t really know what the point of this post is, I guess I’m just feeling grateful tonight for the opportunity to make these realizations before any more damage is done. This group really makes that possible. This is my stream of consciousness at 23 days, 2 hours, and 45 minutes of sobriety.

My drinking is a problem. I don’t eat properly, I don’t really look after myself, physically, mentally, emotionally.

I no longer work.

I wake, tell myself I’m not going to drink today, I walk the dog. I’m knackered. I sleep, I get the kids from school, I feed them, I drink, I sleep. Rinse and repeat.

I’ve drunk problematically for about 30 years. I mean at first it was a way to get rid of childhood angst. Then it became social pub drinking, then the pubs became home drinking, lunch drinking. As long as I didn’t drink before lunch…..

One year ago they tried to stop, it lasted less than a month. I distanced myself from them for many reasons but mostly because their drinking is triggering.

Happy to be sober and alive. Problems with girl still there. I'm still struggling with addiction, now Im picking up weed again - but without alcohol at least I can understand that now and actually address the deeper problems that I've created myself. 

This is a lot about your mental state, I noticed that I need to be locked in and create meaning to life myself.

I've always had a problem with daily routine, never understood daily human life, like going to work, clocking out at 5 pm, eating a dinner and going to sleep. - That is why I always chose drinking, drugs and sex - I've always needed action In my life. I'm glad that being sober from alcohol I can recognize that and I am creating the life I actually want to live. I've launched a digital product, I am working out, sometimes going to sparring. I found out I really like veggies and fruits. 

Well still a huge coffee addict - have to cut off it too.

AND - 

For those who are waiting for their depression to go away - you will see comments saying mostly ""5-6 months""- I know seems long but it is true, I don't know but I am not that depressed anymore.

I've also went back on antidepressants and anxiety meds - I've always refused them and said ""I don't need them"" - second best choice next to becoming sober.  I was depressed, angry, self-hating person - alcohol was just one part of the problem.

Anxiety and depression symptoms are way down, nearly non-existent.

I’m way more patient with my kids, and with people in general.

Work stress doesn’t set me off as much.

I’m not constantly thinking about drinking, though I do have periodic cravings at odd times.

Exercising more regularly, actually seeing improvements in strength, cardio etc. Lost a bit of the beer gut but still a ways to go.

I’m connecting with friends I didn’t “have the time for” previously.

Connecting with new people, mostly at AA which I’m attending 3x/week. Learning a lot!

Feeling like I can actually think ahead, plan for the future.

Rebuilding trust with my spouse, slowly.

Meanwhile I continue to struggling with plenty of things.

I feel generally nervous about relapse and how I’ll respond if I do.

Sleep is still a battle. I have a hard time falling and staying asleep. 

Lots of regrets and resentments are coming to the surface which I’m used to drowning out with alcohol. It’s time to deal with them and/or let them go.

Today the thought of forever sober freaked me out and I doubted whether I could stay the course long-term. Focusing on just today helps, but the fear and doubt persists.

That’s all I’ve got. Sober living is good, feels like I just need to give it time to really feel like myself and like I own this identity. I have my sights set on 100 days, and between then and now I’ll do my best to just stay true to my goals, one step at a time..

1jeew5s,1742329399.0,"Relapsed yesterday I have Mondays and Tuesdays off. This week I had almost no plans, so it was really hard for me to justify not drinking. I’ve been feeling really good and have been making it to 9-12 days in between relapses. Yesterday was day 9, go figure. 

I had 4 tall boys and 7 small boys. I did not intend to drink that much, and when I got up this morning I couldn’t believe I had nothing left. Just one nearly full open can that I poured into the sink. 

I was planning on drinking early and letting it wear off before bed, but is that something an alcoholic has any control over? Certainly not. I drank into the night. I think all I did was listen to music and play rocket league. Thankfully I only sent a few texts and they weren’t that embarrassing. I also didn’t spend any money, but I came dangerously close to buying $500 in concert tickets.

1jerhu7,1742369136.0,"How to know when you have an alcohol/drug problem? Do I have a problem? 

First time ever posting something on reddit - something about having no real life connection to anyone while discussing this topic seems comforting. Anyway.

I’m 25M, grew up in New York City, have lived in 3 other major cities including 2 years abroad. Growing up in NYC life came at me kinda fast and I got exposed to a lot at a young age (sex, drugs and rock and roll - had drank and smoked weed for the first time by the age of 12). The point is - I’ve always been exposed to these things and have never struggled to keep it under control or simply say no. When living abroad in the middle east I had no access to any of kind of alcohol or substances and managed just fine.

I moved back to New York about 2 years ago. Recently (past 3-4 months), I’ve found myself unable to have just one drink, and worse have gotten into the habit of doing hard drugs almost every time I drink (Cocaine for clarification). I work full time, am pursuing an MBA at nights, and have a start up on the side - the drugs and alcohol have not interfered with any of this and I am still performing well in all aspects of life. It’s limited to weekends mostly, but the past few weeks i’ve binged and done drugs on a weekday, sometimes even alone. Still, it hasn’t interfered with my day to day life. 

The problem is, I’m not an idiot, I know this isn’t sustainable and sooner or later it’s going to catch up with me. I can’t have one drink without having many, and I can’t have many without buying drugs. 

My question is why is this happening now when I have had control over this my whole life? Has anyone developed an alcohol or substance abuse later in life after previously being able to balance? Am I overwhelmed by how much is on my plate and feel a need to let loose? If alcohol is a trigger for other things, should I stop drinking all together? Maybe just a break? Any tips for cutting it out completely?

Any thoughts anyone has to offer would go a long way for me - I’m scared to discuss this with the people in my life for fear they wouldn’t understand.

I’ve been sober since March 19th of last year (ALMOST fully sober, I relapsed a couple of times but quickly got back on track) 

Easter is coming up, and Easter is a big celebration for my fiancés family, and they are all fairly heavy drinkers. 

I have no problem turning down a drink in a normal setting, but social situations with his family are incredibly stressful for me, and Easter last year was one of my relapses. 

I have learned some new sobriety skills in the last year, but I am still battling with the thought of a sober Easter with his family. 

Normally I would just stay home and keep myself sober that way, but unfortunately that is not an option as my two young children are going and it will be their first time meeting everyone. (I have 3 month old twins!) I am not comfortable with them being out of my sight around that many people. 

Now, OBVIOUSLY, watching my children and making sure they are well taken care of is my top priority, but I am not naive to the fact that alcohol will still call my name despite having two beautiful kiddos to look after/take care of. 

Anyhow, how are we managing feeling “social” when we are just not social people?

1jdzich,1742282978.0,"How to Sustain Sobriety While Facing Joblessness and the Urgency to Fix Everything? I'm 14 days sober today, and I’m really proud of myself. I’m jobless but have been focusing on my sobriety. Facing reality as it is feels incredibly hard right now. The more I focus on sobriety, the more anxious I become about my career. However, in the past, I’ve been self-centered, and that mindset has derailed me every time. So, it just doesn’t feel right to jump into fixing everything else unless I first change my ways.

I’ve done this before in a fellowship, but back then, I was more driven by the fear of being judged if I drank. When I relapsed, I couldn’t be honest because I was paranoid about what others would think. This time, my paranoia is different. I'm not afraid of people’s judgment, but of the silent guy in my head. Because relapse itself isn’t the biggest problem. Losing vigilance is. That guy sneaks in quietly, takes over the front seat, and once he does, I don’t care how destructive my drinking was or will be. I just drink, no matter what. That’s why I’m taking my time to explore and figure out ways to sustain my sobriety before I rush to fix my job and career.

I’ve realized that fellowship, doing the necessary work, constantly checking in, and actively participating with others are some of the ways to expose this silent guy and stay vigilant. That's why i am sharing here.  I’m not going to make any major life changes until I have a stronger foundation. But at the same time, doing nothing about other areas of my life is killing me.

1jdfdgm,1742225333.0,"First sober year as an adult. I’m not sure how people feel about these but I thought I’d share my thoughts on my first year sober. Probably more for me, but maybe it helps someone. I’m a rambler so this will end up being a novel I’m sure.

My backstory: I started drinking when I was 14 (stopped at 30). Loved it instantly. I’ve been wanting to drink every weekend since (and eventually every day). Tried just about every version of “just on holidays”, “only if I’m with people” that I could come up with. None stuck. Stopped for 6 months once and stopped for 3 months another time when I had particularly embarrassing situations in the presence of my wife. But I didn’t actually stop, I just took breaks. I didn’t “prove that I could stop”. I was always coming back, and acting like I would drink moderately when I started back up was always something I knew was a lie. 

Finally broke down and told my wife that I was done for good. I told her to never, ever be ok with me drinking no matter what the stipulations were. She agreed. I haven’t really come close to starting back since. Despite all the times I did my “white lies” where I told her I was only drinking 3 that night even though I was opening two at a time so it would sound like one, Sober me won’t outright lie to my wife. I won’t pretend I’m sober even though I have been drinking. So I’ve made it a year like this. 

I don’t give myself a ton of credit for it because I’m certain it wouldn’t have happened if I was single. And I think that’s okay. I’d love to be someone who is strong and can withstand the cravings by myself, but I’ve proven I’m not. I’m lucky to have this excellent support system, especially my wife, and I’m proud of myself for taking advantage of that. I may think of myself as weak mentally, but I was strong when I asked my wife to never let me drink again. I knew what that meant, and what I was signing myself up for. I think I always knew I could end my drinking by doing that but I couldn’t handle the thought of it. It still makes me sick to think about it. But I did it. And I’m very proud of that. There was another moment where I was strong, when she asked me “so do you even want me to not let you drink when _____” and I quickly told her to never give me an opening like that again. I probably could’ve started back on the path to drinking right then. But I didn’t. I ripped of the bandaid and told her no before I could think about it. That was strong, and I’m proud of that. I may think of myself as weak and beat myself up all the time, but I’m very proud of those two moments of strength. They changed (and maybe saved) my life.

I’m too antisocial for AA. I know they’re generally a very accepting bunch and I’m sure I wouldn’t be judged, but I just get to anxious speaking in front of multiple people. This subreddit has been nice for making me realize there’s a ton of people doing the same exact things I’ve been beating myself up for all this time. I saw a therapist for like 7 or 8 months. She was helpful in a similar way. I would explain my problems and she would basically be like “yep, that’s common, here’s our typical tools to deal with that”. It helped me realize it might not be me being very weak, maybe I’m just another one of alcohol’s victims.

If anyone is new to sobriety and doesn’t know the mantras and coping mechanisms, there are some cool ones. The “one day at a time” is obviously helpful because it breaks the battle into more achievable sections. But what I didn’t realize was when you’ve decided to *never* drink again rather than just trying to stop indefinitely, it is VERY overwhelming to think about. One day at a time helps make it less overwhelming. Looking up the immediate health benefits of stopping drinking was a game changer too. I was very nervous about the consequences of all that drinking. It was cool to see how much healing your body can do if you actually give it a chance. 

I realized how much my guilt level had changed when talking to my therapist. Hangovers are guilt factories. That guilt isn’t real and doesn’t translate to sobriety. I never knew that. I thought of myself as a bad father to my toddler. I thought of myself as a bad husband. I’d always thought I’d be good at both. I couldn’t love them as much as I wanted to because of how sad my performance made me. When I realized that everything had changed and I was getting down on the floor with my boy and trying hard to split all the parental/household/financial duties with my wife, it was a huge relief. I obviously have flaws and things I want to improve in those departments, but it really rocked me when I realized I could fully love my family because I wasn’t overwhelmed with guilt. I cried hard about that one.

My therapist compared the devastation of not being able to drink again to mourning the loss of a loved one. As bad as I think that sounds, it’s very accurate and exactly how I feel. I can barely handle thinking about never drinking again. I go through this cycle that goes like this: I crave the drinking, I realize I can’t, I realize I never can again, I get very sad that I’ll never drink again, I try to think of some way to drink again, I feel like it’s unfair that I can’t, then I imagine what it would be like to live in a different reality where I can drink whenever I want. I do this most days. A year later. I do this most days. It can be exhausting.

Here are some things I’ve learned in sobriety:

The most important thing is probably that there isn’t some type of scale effect where the good outweighs the bad. I used to do these pros and cons lists to try and explain to myself that drinking isn’t even that fun and it’s so much better being sober because of reasons 1-2-3-4-5. It doesn’t really work like that for me, the good and the bad are two separate things that don’t really affect each other. My sober life is better in COUNTLESS ways. I’m so freaking happy and I get these like euphoric feelings of pure joy. I love my life and my family and I feel so lucky. But I also feel near daily anguish and like devastation that I can’t drink even though I know how much worse I felt back then. I think when I was going through all my attempts at quitting and reasoning with myself, it would’ve been helpful to know that there’s no scale.

I blamed a lot of things on my alcohol abuse and constant state of being hungover. Once I was sober, it still took a lot of effort to do things I was wanting to do like eating healthy, exercising, etc. I mean it is DEFINITELY easier when sober, but that doesn’t meant it’s easy. Sometimes when I have regressions with my self-improvement, it feels a lot like when I failed in an attempt at sobriety. Instead of feeling like I’m constantly failing, I’ve had to retrain my brain to accept the setbacks as a part of growth. And with alcohol no longer there to blame, I was able to see a clearer picture of what was holding me back.

I’ve realized that sober me and drinking/hungover me are truly two different people. For my entire adult life, I was consistently drinking or recovering from drinking. This past year is my first year being a sober adult. I’ve always assumed that drinking has caused me to be more extreme in certain bad habits, or cause exaggerations of certain traits. But some things are night and day and completely different. It’s hard for me to grasp that the person I’ve been for the past year is the “real me” and that the alcohol was causing certain traits and habits that weren’t true to me. All I’ve ever known was alcohol me. I’ve only been this person for a year, I was that other person for 15 years. It’s a bit easier to believe in this new me now that it’s been a year, but I really struggled with it when I had only been sober for a few months. I had this mindset of imposter syndrome and I thought my newfound productivity and energy would certainly revert back since I had been lazy for what felt like my whole life.

Being able to drink moderately sounds great only because I know it’s a gateway to drinking as often as I really want. When I actually think about it, I don’t really care about drinking moderately. I’ve learned that I mostly get cravings to drink during times that I used to know I wouldn’t get judged for drinking. I always wanted to drink, but was always worried that it wasn’t a socially acceptable time to drink. So when I was in those socially acceptable times, I got really excited. And I still do. I used to not understand why I would get excited to drink when it would be a time that I wouldn’t have even enjoyed the drinking experience. But enjoyment wasn’t the goal, drinking was the goal. I find it hard to grasp that there’s some kind of chemical change or whatever in my brain that makes me more susceptible to alcohol abuse than others. Maybe it’s always been in me or maybe it’s something that the years of abuse caused. Probably a mixture. But when I get those overwhelming cravings, and it’s a situation where I wouldn’t even enjoy the drinking experience, I can believe it then.

If you read all the way to the end, that means a lot to me. Thank you.

So today’s the day. St Patrick’s Day. An excuse for every Irish person or anyone for that matter to drink themselves into oblivion.

I say this to say dying from alcohol isn’t always the lonely old man who’s well into his 70’s sitting at the bar drinking their sorrows. It can be a 35 year old who should have been in the prime of their life leaving behind 4 young children. I’m 32, so I’m not far off of his age. I knew if I didn’t quit now I would follow the same fate. I knew I most likely wouldn’t have made it to 40. I’m proud to say I’m 14days sober.

Another day 4. Feeling happier than during other attempts so I thought I'd share some small wins that have happened over the last 4 days. For context, I have been a near-nightly binge drinker for several years and before that would engage in binge drinking at least once a week if not more. What I think has shifted at least for now  is that for a long time I felt like I was depriving myself if I couldn't drink (I say this optimistically, as if I won't ever relapse, but). I realize that this is not uncommon. Something shifted the last few days and I've started romanticizing the process of an alcohol detox. Romanticizing getting well has been more effective at reducing my shame than anything else so far. Anyway...

My pants already fit better. Flushing out even a little edema helps, I think. Having less pressure over my abdomin is cozier than I remembered.

The bags under my eyes are already a little less pronounced. Better sleep and more hydrated.

Speaking of sleep, it's already improving. Still tossing and turning some, plenty of sweat, but I don't wake up in a panic or wake up in the morning feeling like I'm in a desert.

Little things feel nicer. Not to be dramatic, but the breeze feels more refreshing, food tastes better, my cat's fur feels softer. I think I'm dissociating less.

I feel myself wanting to want things for myself again. Like, I don't completely know what I want, but I have a yearning to want things again. Hope that makes sense.

Ended up going to a happy place for a week. Still suffered from fear of panic attacks months afterwards even though I was sober. But I got in to see a psychiatrist. 

Then, I went to see an old friend turned romantic interest and flew to him. He was mentally and physically abusive on our weekend together which has never happened to me before. That sent me on a spiral where I couldn’t keep anything together. I flunked out of my first semester back at college trying to get my degree as an adult. I was assaulted by a coworker at a brand new job at a restaurant on my first night because I was blackout afterwards. 

Still, fought like hell to survive. Got sober again, stayed on my meds. Then in October ended up end the hospital with a rare tonsil abscess that they removed while I was awake 😭 that cost me $8000. 

Still, kept going. Then, on my way home from a meeting, a random man tried to attack me and told me “god told me you were going to be my lover” and I fought him off with pepper spray a girl at a meeting had just given me days before. The police never found him and it was in my neighborhood.

1jcqvee,1742146542.0,"A few short months ago... I had my world fall apart due to my drinking. I had quit initially in 2020 and those few years were the happiest of my life.

In 2023 a landslide of things happened in my life all at once. We made a big move for the business I own (from a place where we were very content), my youngest daughter was diagnosed with severe autism, my business partner and husband had a huge fight that just bled into my life with them trash talking eachother to me, my husband and my marriage were on the rocks, my desperation to grow my business was making me mental, and I fell into the bottom of the bottle.

At first it was like, once a week and only socially. Then it was once a week at home alone. Then it was 2-3 times per week, and I blacked out each time. Then it started bleeding into the next morning so that I could function. 

It was hell. And 2 months ago I decided I can't live like this anymore. I've had 2 hiccups since then but each hangover reminded me of how badly I did not want this to be my life.

I haven't had a slip up in a month, and I'm losing the cravings because every time I think about drinking, I'm reminded of the pounding headaches in the morning, the inability to function (or trying to force myself to overachieve to make up for my poor decisions the night before while feeling extremely sick), and the overall depression and anxiety that lingered for days following a drinking relapse.

1jcnh0k,1742137582.0,"My love (tossic) story with alcohol Please, don’t be scared by the post lenght, I need help

Hi everyone! 37 y/o guy here!

I found this sub while searching online for discussion forums for people struggling with alcohol issues. I thought I’d join to both give and receive support.

Here’s my story: I’ve always had a bad relationship with alcohol. My first real drunk experience, if I remember correctly, was around 14/15 years old. Me and my friends would buy all kinds of liquor, lock ourselves in someone’s house or an abandoned place, and drink and smoke until we felt sick.

Since then, alcohol abuse has been an on-and-off thing for me. Until I was 21, I would drink only a few times a year, maybe once a month on average. But from 21 to 32, things got worse. I changed social circles, went out more often, and would drink heavily 3-4 times a week. Up to that point, my relationship with alcohol was bad, but at least it was occasional — meaning, if I didn’t go out for a month, I wouldn’t touch alcohol at all.

Then what happened? The pandemic. Like for many people, I guess, that changed everything. I was stuck at home, and to pass the time, I started buying beer every single day. And not just one beer — a lot of beer, and the strongest I could find. Because for me, drinking is never “just drinking.” For me, drinking means drinking until I’m drunk — until my brain shuts off, until I stop thinking, until even stupid things seem fun.

From the start of the pandemic until 2024, I’ve been drinking pretty much every day — at least 1 to 1.5 liters of 9% beer. In the past year, thanks to my girlfriend asking me to cut down, I’ve reduced it a bit (now I drink 3-4 times a week), but honestly, it’s not my choice — and that makes it hard. Also, whenever she’s not around, I drink as much as I can, like I’m trying to “make up” for the missed drinking.

I think there are many reasons why I have such a bad relationship with alcohol. Genetics (both my grandparents were alcoholics), my introversion, my social anxiety.

I never really thought alcohol was a problem until I saw that my drinking was a problem for others — especially for my girlfriend. I want to quit for her, yes, but more than anything, I want to quit for myself, because I want to be okay. I don’t want to depend on anything or anyone.

I used to smoke for many years, but I quit, and honestly, it wasn’t that hard. Now, I’ll occasionally have a cigarette when I’m out with friends (like one a month, maybe even less), but I have no problem managing that — I never relapsed.

But with alcohol, I just can’t. Sometimes I manage to stay away from it for a few days, but then the first time I go out with friends, or any other excuse, I end up drinking again. And let’s be honest — society kind of shoves drinks down your throat without you even realizing it.

Right now, I drink 3-4 days a week, 1 liter (or sometimes more) of high-alcohol beer. The weird thing is that the craving always kicks in during the afternoon/evening, between 4:30 pm and 8:30 pm. If I can get through that time window, I’m safe. But man, those hours are hell. I wake up and don’t even think about drinking, but as the day goes on and that hour gets closer, the urge just grows and I can’t resist.

Sorry for the long post. As you probably guessed, this is mostly a rant :D I hope to find and give some support here — even though, from someone like me, I don’t know how much help others can expect.

Sending a hug to all of you!

1jcpq7b,1742143608.0,"Day 3 after 10 months of a relapse June 17th of last year my entire world changed when I lost the love of my life, my beautiful Irish setter Seamus. We won’t even talk about 2 days later my horse injuring her eye which ended up being almost 5 months of constant care and 14k bill 😅 I drank myself stupid for about 2 weeks and ever since then have never made it past 3 days regardless of my efforts. Did I mention my one year of sobriety would have been July 5th of last year? Sigh. 

This past Thursday I drank an entire 6 pack and then drunkenly ordered more from a delivery service. I felt horrible Friday, and the lowest mentally ever yesterday. I cancelled a date with an ex of mine to purchase an expensive coffee and read for the evening. Usually I would have just succumbed to sadness and gotten a 6 pack but I didn’t want it. Today I woke up feeling amazing regardless of the rain and an antsy 10 month old Gordon setter pup. 

I found myself enjoying the morning, and took advantage of a break in rain to run some errands. I usually hate people and found myself interacting with them and just being overall…happy? The sun came out on the way home, which would usually be a signal to grab beer on a Sunday. Instead I’m making a fancy brunch for myself while I read and hope the weather stays nice so I can run my pup later. 

Has anyone else struggled in a short cycle and then just weirdly just not had any cravings? Even my thoughts are different. I’m sitting here in my head making plans for re-integrating lifting in the mornings which I haven’t done in 10 months and deciding on evenings to ride my horse again. 

I’m almost terrified to feel happy or hopeful because of how sudden these feelings happened. 

If you made it through this rambling novel of basically nothing, thank you 💜 hoping I can post here at a week of sobriety in a few days!

1jch2sr,1742114170.0,"365 Around the Sun and a year older I feel confused and tired but happy

New years eve 2023 I made a decision to quit. I was out watching the fireworks and downed half a bottle of brandy to ”solidify” the decision… oh boy

It took a couple of months to get to a Day 1 but it was exactly like this day. Saturday night that managed to stay sober and wake up to Sunday so fresh and so clean. The high was life changing. 

That Sunday I decided to quit coffee as well and started drinking tea instead - now I brew two glass jars of lemonized ice-tea from a wide selection of black, green, mate, rooibos, herbal

That Sunday I restarted my old yoga-routine that had been on a long break for at least a decade (kids, marriage, work etc excuses)
Now I go through 1-2h yoga-excersize-meditation-y-choung-tai-chi combo almost every day. I have lost some weight. Motivation and focus are better, I feel like a champ as I used to feel like a chump. 

I used the ”pink cloud energy” to the fullest and got a handfull of projects going on. Still going on. 
I started eating healthier and more veggie/vegan diet. Not completely cause my kid (6yo) still wants her hot digs and meat balls and so on. 
And I still destroy chips and candy like my life depended on them. I try to get out more and make it count. 

Last spring will definitely be the turning point in my life, and it’s about f**ing time too. I’m turning 46 on May. 

I learned so much about myself during the first months. I relapsed a few times in the autumn, a fall fell if you please. And I learned so much more collecting my soul from the floor recovering from the resulting mental relapse. It made me stronger and more willing to push through. 

All very well, couldn’t be prouder, and being proud of myself is not a common thing. I’m GenX and ignored and forgotten by parents and society for decades. I’d say any warm feelings about myself, are luke warm at best and still artificial. 
But I do feel good. Really good. Better than ever even, since I started drinking at 13 or 14 (wtf)

I had a sober year on 2015-16 in hind sight I should’ve stayed on the wagon then. 
2019 a divorce I didn’t want was the final straw. 2020-2024 I downed a bottle of whiskey/vodka/brandy every single day. 
Beer I quit somewhere around 2021/22 cause it just didn’t do it for me, only got me bloated and fat. 
I never went to a doctor. I never went to AA. 
I didn’t seek any help from anyone. My family pretty much left me alone after hearing I don’t drink - I used to be a reliant drinking buddy for them. 

But you wanna know what happened on that Saturday last year, before my Day 1?

I found r/stopdrinking by accident



I should end it there for dramatic reasons but I still want to thank everyone on this sub and couple of other subs as well, for the billionth time. Thank You for saving my life. I will and I have been trying to return the favor. After all, this is just Year 1

1jcdvma,1742100224.0,"Naltrexone update Hi everyone, I posted a week and a half ago about my first impressions of naltrexone on 25 mg.  I wanted to update everyone...I hope some find this useful, including people using google to research it.

I jumped up to the 50 mg dosage 5 days ago.  This medicine is profoundly affecting me.

I still have cravings, but then I literally forget about them.  I don't dwell on them, I don't ruminate, it doesn't build and build like a snowball going down a hill...it just goes away.

Overall I don't have a big desire to drink.  I'm able to leave work and not be overwhelmed with needing it.  It just kinda fades into the distance.

I got a tall boy last night, took some sips, got half way done after 2 hours (which is forever for me, I'm a binge drinker), and didn't finish the rest.  I didn't want it.  I wasn't sad it was ""over"", as I always was in the past.  And I didn't feel tipsy or great, no rush.  It was fine.  Not bad, not good.  No reward from it.  

It has profoundly affected much more though-my food cravings are way, way down and I have reduced appetite.  I've realized I've had disordered eating for a long time-i no longer make plans and fantasize what I'm going to eat later in the day, and most food is just ok...I don't walk out of work with food every day even though I have food at home.   And I can stop when I'm full.  Fantasizing about food is almost totally gone.

No sex drive which is fine (at the moment).  I can recognize hot guys, and think about kissing them or whatever, but it doesn't occupy my mind.

Even money-i got extra in my paycheck this week, and have no urge to spend it.  The thrill just isn't there.  I'm just like, eh?  I'll get what I need and that's it.  Very little desire to spend more on frivolous things.  I didn't expect that ""side effect"".  Usually it'd be burning a hole, ready for a dopamine hit.

I also feel a mild sense of general calm for some reason.

If it helps to know, I am bipolar and have been on very successful medicine for a while now

Some side effects are i feel a bit in a daze, sometimes my feet/legs feel kinda heavy which can make walking feel a bit odd, I do take Zofran right now to help with nausea (low dose), I can get a bit dizzy unfortunately.  Some constipation that is going away now at the 50 mg.  Also it is causing drowsiness, but I'm so used to it from my bipolar meds that it's not a huge deal.

I hope this helps anyone out there who is curious about it, researching it, or at the end of their rope, desperate for something to finally work and ""click"".  I was so, so desperate.  I was afraid of the med, and put it off for so long, now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long and putting myself through such misery.

I know it definitely doesn't work for everyone, and some people can't tolerate it.  But so far it's been amazing, even way beyond the alcohol issue.

I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.

I hope my ""review"" or experience helps even just one person out there-alcoholism is such a terrible, soul stealing, life draining scourge.  This is just my first step in really, truly getting better.  Therapy will start soon.  This is just a tool, not ""the answer"".

Hope everyone is well, keep truckin, and hang in there.  There is hope, there are multiple ways to get better.  You all can do it.  I finally feel like I *might* be able to, as well, instead of be a complete failure.
