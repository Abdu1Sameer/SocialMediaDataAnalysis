This project focuses on extracting, analyzing, and visualizing social media posts related to mental health distress, substance use, and suicidality using data from Twitter/X and Reddit APIs.

## Key Features
- Data Extraction & Preprocessing: Retrieves relevant posts and filters them based on high-risk keywords.
- Sentiment & Risk Classification: Applies TextBlob for sentiment analysis and TF-IDF similarity to classify risk levels.
